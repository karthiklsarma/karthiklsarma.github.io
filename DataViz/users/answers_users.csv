<p>I also quite dislike the use of the word ""prior beliefs"" which gets attach to prior probabilities in the Bayesian world.  It brings over the wrong connotations - I think ""prior assumptions"" or ""prior state of knowledge"" better describes what is actually encapsulated by ""the prior"" of Bayesian statistics.</p>

<p>I do some things again and again, or my code does (almost) the same thing again and again.  Iterating isn't tedious <em>per se</em>, but it helps to iterate rapidly.  I am mastering that.</p>

<p>I work on topics in many areas, usually solving stimulating problems with stimulating data.  Sometimes there is a stimulating amount of stimulating data.</p>

<p>To contact me, look for me in the SO R chat room, where I am often learning from R experts, or leave a message there or in a separate chat (@Iterator) - SO will alert me.</p>

Should be out in the Autumn. If you want me to let you know as soon as it comes out (and get a discount code!), send me an email (address is below).</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm director at QQ Trends, a company that solves difficult data and software challenges for our clients. (We often have freelance projects, so get in touch if interested.)</p>

<p>My book, ""Data Push Apps with HTML5 SSE"" is out and selling!

<p>UPDATE: looking for another part-time CSS/JS programmer. 理想は東京所在、日本語が読める方。Interesting project(s), you will definitely learn something.</p>

<p>(And, of course, please do get in touch if you have interesting challenges that you would like our world-class experts to work on!)</p>

<p>Typical work: doing fun stuff with data (fixing, mining, etc.), web sites (front and back-ends), trading strategies. Research: trading strategies, computer go, machine translation, understanding context, AI search algorithms. Languages: C++, PHP, R, javascript, and many more. </p>

<p>I'm British, living and working in Tokyo for almost 20 years. Human Languages: English, Japanese (fairly fluent, 1 kyu), some German, Chinese and Arabic.</p>

<p>(Contact me at dc at qqtrend dot com: please mention you are coming from StackOverflow, so I know it is not spam.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Easy ways to irritate me on StackExchange sites (whether my own question or someone else's): 1. Downvote without a comment (N/A if someone already left a comment and you just agree with it, of course); 2. Answer in comments. Other than that I'm a really easy-going and pragmatic guy :-)</p>

Well, let's say starting then I always tried to expand my knowledge. While I still am not a typical wizard at some topic, I believe I have collected a fair amount of knowledge over various areas. </p>

<p>These includes all of the three major desktop operating systems being used those days (with Windows being the least favored one and all Linux distributions counted as one single systems), as well as quite a lot of programming languages. </p>

<p>In my later years I decided to study mathematics, which helped me to sharpen my logical reasoning and develop a toolset of problem solving methods.</p>

<p>In 2011 I finished my M. Sc. in Maths and started working as a data- and process analyst at one of Germany's major companies. </p>

<p>In parallel I am working part-time on my PhD, researching one practical application for B-Splines and the methods that can be used for that. </p>

<p>Right now the languages and applications I use frequently are MATLAB, R and C++, as well as LaTeX, if one wants to call that a programming language (well, it's Turing-complete, isn't it?). Furthermore, I started getting used to Emacs and loving it - here, though, I'm only scratching on the surface.</p>

I focus more on computation and thinking about things in an abstract way to ""hack"" solutions; although the statistical foundations do help.</p>

<p>My tool of choice is R, but I used to rely on Excel, VBA, and sometimes SAS.  Beyond that, I know a little bit about many other languages and tools. Oh, and I do a little work in Hadoop as well.</p>

Professional programmers helping each other while learning.  Now I cannot ask a question without ""showing what I have done"" because ""people aren't here to do free work"".  I used to do ""free work"" and I enjoyed it - see my old answers below - but these days all people seem to care about is whether you are cheating at homework.  So I no longer participate here.</p>

<hr>

<p>I work on projects that mix computing and physics - I have a pile of experience as a software engineer, but my education, way back in the day, was as an astronomer.  It was research in astronomy that first took me to Chile, where I now live.  So I telecommute from Santiago, working with companies in the USA and UK.  Currently I'm part of a small team developing software related to geophysics - I guess you could call it a consultancy, but really we're just people that understand what you need and then - importantly! - make it.</p>

<p>Some of my favourite answers:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/7237972/181772"">Exploring constraint programming</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/7086514/181772"">Converting recursion to iteration with Python generators</a></li>

<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/17840228/181772"">Matching integer ranges with regexps</a></li>

<p>In every case I learnt something new, which <strike>is</strike>was what's so good about this site :)</p>

Interested in Semantic Web, Linked Open Data, Information Visualization and Semantic Multimedia. I work mostly with JavaScript, Python and Java. My interest in programming languages (especially dynamic ones) has led me to test/benchmark lots of programming languages and frameworks like Ruby + Ruby On Rails, Groovy + Grails, Scala, and others. Before my PhD I worked as a Java programmer for a number of years in different outsourcing companies from Romania. After I started my PhD studies I discovered they required me to travel a lot (summer schools, workshops, conferences, etc) and at some point I moved to Austria to take a position of Researcher since it was more in line with my new interests. Here I became interested in force directed layouts, charts, diagrams, 3D visualizations in the browser, high performance JavaScript and other visualization topics. Since both my work and my PhD are concerned with Semantic Web, my articles and most of the projects I work for are related to this area. From the semantic stack of technologies I use Sesame, RDF, OWL, SPARQL, reasoning (rules languages, DSLs, different OWL flavours).</p>

<p>In addition I had a lot to to with statistics. Especially the effect size for the <em>t-test</em> for <em>repeated measurements</em>. </p>

I realize that I am moving away from my education, as marketing in the real world is just as much about trading and advertising as it is about clustering consumer groups and what follows.

<p>Someone just trying to learn LaTeX. No books about LaTeX, nor packages in CTAN, but a I'm proud of a few answers (hint: not always they the most upvoted). My apologies if you find unclear what I write. English is not my native language.</p>

<p><strong>Precooked comments:</strong> <a href=""http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/questions/430/text-building-blocks"">http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/questions/430/text-building-blocks</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/1436"">Welcome to TeX.sx!</a> Please add a <a href=""http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/228"">minimal working example (MWE)</a> that illustrates your problem. It will be much easier for us to reproduce your situation and find out what the issue is when we see compilable code, starting with <code>\documentclass{...}</code> and ending with <code>\end{document}</code>.</p>

<p>A tip: If you <a href=""http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/1192"">indent lines by 4 spaces</a> or <a href=""http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/q/863"">enclose words in backticks ```</a>, they'll be marked as code, as can be seen in my edit. You can also highlight the code and click the ""code"" button (with ""{}"" on it).</p>

<p><a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/130200/22228"">What is the distribution of R2 in linear regression under the null hypothesis?</a> My answer includes a comprehensive graphic of the distribution of $R^2$ for multiple regression on a small sample.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/q/131400/22228"">Ink to data ratio and plot backgrounds</a> - a fascinating question about the recent trend for plots to have grey backgrounds.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/125368/22228"">Uniform random variable as sum of two random variables</a> - if $U$ is a uniform variable, why can't we find i.i.d. variables $X$ and $Y$ such that $U=X+Y$? A nice solution by thinking about limits on kurtosis.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/139683/22228"">Random walk on the edges of a cube</a> - if a spider walks at random along the edges, what is the expected number of steps to reach an ant trapped on the opposite vertex? Parity considerations give an elementary pen-and-paper method.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/125575/22228"">What does an Added Variable Plot (Partial Regression Plot) explain in a multiple regression?</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/q/119835/22228"">Correlation between a nominal (IV) and a continuous (DV) variable</a> - sometimes we have to explain that something can't be done, but suggest alternatives or analogues.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/a/122572/22228"">Prove the equivalence of the following two formulas for Spearman correlation</a> - using only high school methods. This is a bit clunky, but the topic sometimes comes up at high school level (at least in my country), so it's nice not to have to rely on higher level maths.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/q/74147/22228"">Expectation of Quotient of Sums of IID Random Variables (Cambridge University Worksheet)</a> - an interesting question that can be answered by (a)symmetry considerations.</p>

The King of kings and Lord of lords, God blessed forever, Jesus the Christ. Without Him you don't have anything but eternal torment (no annihilation) in Hell because of your sinful nature. Don't take your life for granted, everything you see is for a brief time and then will vanish. How come you care about everything except your very life that may stop at any moment? But that won't be the end, for there will be a righteous Judgment waiting for you after that according to the Bible, how horrible?
So dear sinner, with all love even in LaTeX: is He your personal Savior? If not you are in utter danger, but I am glad to tell you that in Him there is hope as He never rejects a broken sinner, seriously troubled with his sins. Come to Him with all of your burdens, but you can ever trust Him Who is Mighty to Save.
Repent, not relying on yourself but on His perfect and finished work on the Cross at Calvary, and believe in the gospel, even today, for the kingdom of God is at hand.</p>

I support R as a statistical package, since it enhances worldwide communication of replicable research. For one, R does not require a paid license, making it a viable package for many universities across the globe that are unable to afford expensive main stream packages. Thus code written in R can be run by just about anyone. For more wealthy private and public universities, it is more value for beneficiaries', respectively tax payers' money. Also, R is open source software, making it possible to actually evaluate the commands that are being used, as well as to edit them or write your own.</p>

I completed my graduate training in June 2013, receiving my PhD in clinical child psychology from DePaul University.</p>

<p>In addition to my work in Psychology, in 2008 I founded my own statistical and research consulting company (www.statsmakemecry.com) and I continue to operate this company on a part-time basis.

In addition to consulting services, my company's website offers a blog, video tutorials, and other helpful resources, all of which are free to all users.</p>

I currently work in Financial Markets and Banking as a Software and Business Analyst. I have a minor in Computer Engineering, which I completely neglected during college. Now I'm trying to catch up. But mostly I consider myself just a hobbyist trying to teach myself electronics.</p>

<p>Things I like the most in electronics:</p>

<ol>
<li>To design and etch my own PCBs at home (mostly with thru-role components, with an occasional SMD part to spice things up)</li>
<li>To play with the oscilloscope</li>
<li>To light up LEDs and 7-segment displays</li>
<li>To gut toy RC cars and redo their electronics</li>
<li>To organize my electronics components into neat boxes</li>
<li>To browse questions and answers here at EE.SE and to edit posts to make them shine (when I can, that is, but I'm especially fond of fixing equations formatting using MathJaX)</li>

If you need to contact me regarding how I handled a post on Stack Overflow, please do so <em>on the site</em>. The best option for contact is raising a flag on the relevant post or, if I left a comment on the post, responding to that comment.</p>

<hr>

<p>I am a business school lecturer and postdoc, and I received my PhD in operations research. My research interests involve data-driven decision making in the healthcare space, with a focus on designing combination drug therapies for advanced cancer and on designing population screening strategies for cancer.</p>

<p>On Stack Overflow, I'm most active in <a href=""/questions/tagged/mathematical-optimization"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;mathematical-optimization&#39;"" rel=""tag"">mathematical-optimization</a> (where I am the first recipient of a bronze badge) and <a href=""/questions/tagged/r"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;r&#39;"" rel=""tag"">r</a>. I most enjoy answering questions that either deal with code optimization or mathematical optimization. My favorite answer I've contributed so far has this flavor:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/31037761/3093387"">Given island and water locations on a grid and the cost of building a bridge on each water square, where should you build bridges to connect the islands at minimum cost?</a></li>
</ul>

<p>When I'm not working or on Stack Overflow, you might find me playing my favorite physical sport (tennis), playing my favorite mental sport (bridge), or playing with my cat Neptune (pictured).</p>

He completed a PhD in snow hydrology at the University of Edinburgh (Q1 2016), which was based around an historic dataset (Snow Survey of Great Britain). He used this to demonstrate a link between snow cover and climate fluctuations and better understand snow cover and melt frequency through computer modelling and statistics. You can read more about Mike's research on his blog, <a href=""http://scottishsnow.wordpress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scottishsnow.wordpress.com</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to Mike's return to university he worked as a hydrologist for Environment Agency Wales and Halcrow Group Ltd. He worked on projects including river and coastal flood mapping, flood defence scheme design, river reallignment, flood forecasting (operationally and model development) and flood risk assessment. Mike graduated from Lancaster University in 2004 with a BSc in Environmental Science.</p>

<p>Mike is excited about beginning a new, data science challenge in 2016: please get in touch if you think your project will be of interest.

My work at school has been in applied statistics for social networks, and I am using this work in Baltimore architecting networks of support for Green Street's parents.</p>

<p>Every year or so I undertake a new website that either collects data, or reminds me to do things -- this is how I have developed most of my development powers, after getting a Minor in CS at Stanford.</p>

<p>I use python for my sites, an assortment of projects like web scrapers, and occasionally for statistical work, but prefer R when I can get away with it.</p>

In my day-to-day I work on banging together some of the work I've done towards my PhD into a publishable format and on building my machine learning and optimization portfolio. I am especially interested in non parametric techniques to get things done. The languages I am most comfortable with are Matlab and C++; however, my plan is to use languages I barely know--python and R--to showcase my ML skills as they are the prominent tools in this field. Additional interests / hobbies include but not limited to: photonics, FPGA, quantum computing and pondering on how to use emerging tech to change the way we live.</p>

This (hopefully) represents the start of a late career change from accountancy. I came across TeX and LaTeX while participating in a maths forum at the Open University, and subsequently attended an introductory course given by Joseph Wright in London at the end of August 2011.  My plan is to write my PhD thesis in LaTeX, though this seems to be a rarity in the biomedical sciences. My supervisors have given me strict instructions to write it in MS Word, so it's going to get interesting...</p>

The majority of my work is focused on freshwater  wetlands but have been known to venture into the marine environment. I enjoy quantitative analysis and rely heavily on statistics. Overall I feel that I have a strong statistics background but can always learn more!!!</p>

<p>I am ecologist with a multi-disciplinary background and can easily straddle the line between biologist and chemist.</p>

I'm also interested in social behaviour and animal play behaviour. I try to strike a good balance between theory and practice, so I combine fieldwork with mathematical modelling and thorough statistical analysis.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I do not just take an interest in Science, but also in history and literature. Mythology and fairy tales have been a great passion of mine for most of if not all my life.</p>

He obtained his MD diploma magna cum laude at the University of Milan, Italy, in 1999. He completed compulsory military service in 2000 as Medical Officer in the 183rd Parachute Regiment of the Italian Army in Pistoia, Italy, as well as serving as Chief Medical Officer in the Task Force Falco of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), in Dakovica, Kosovo. He then pursued specialist training in cardiovascular medicine at the Catholic University, Rome, Italy. In 2004-2005 he completed a fellowship in interventional cardiology at St. Raffaele University Hospital, Milan, Italy. He later worked as consultant cardiologist at St. Donato Hospital, St. Donato, and Abano Terme Hospital, Abano Terme, both in Italy. Since 2006 he has served as Assistant Professor, until 2010 at the University of Turin, Turin, Italy, during 2011 at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy, and since late 2011 at Sapienza University of Rome, Latina, Italy. He has also attended doctoral courses in biomedical statistics at the Biometrics and Medical Statistics Institute of the University of Milan, Italy, and has obtained in 2015 a Master of Statistics diploma at Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy. Among Dr. Biondi Zoccai's research interests are advanced biostatistical methods and evidence based medicine in cardiology, intracoronary stents, and the impact of inflammation in heart disease. He also founded an international collaboration dedicated to meta-analysis and evidence-based cardiology training (METCARDIO, available online at metcardio.org). As a whole, he has coauthored more than 500 scholarly articles and has edited two books on evidence synthesis.</p>

I use a combination of long-term monitoring, lab experiments, and meta-analysis to address these questions.</p>

I do research and teach in a broad range of areas including entrepreneurship, strategy, technology &amp; innovation, engineering management, and open source. I'm a phenomenon-driven researcher and my focus is on open source entrepreneurship and strategy. I use multiple theoretical lenses and methods in order to understand the use, contingencies, and scope of open source strategies by both established firms and startups. My research contributes both to the academic literature and to the practice of strategic management in technical and non-technical firms alike. My research agenda has laid the foundation for a research that is slated for submission to top-tier journals including IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, Academy of Management Review, Strategic Management Journal, Journal of Business Venturing, Technology Innovation Management Review, and Organization Science, amongst others. I have received numerous awards from both the Academy of Management and the Administrative Sciences Association of Canada, including best student paper and best reviewer awards.</p>

<p>I'm a Professional Engineer (P.Eng.) with extensive entrepreneurship, industry, and government experience. My consulting focus has been in helping nascent organizations answer the question ""How can I make free and open source tools and methods work for me?"". Every organization is different, with different needs and different definitions for ""success"", so I focus on helping organizations map out their unique long-term strategic path to success, however success is measured for them, in their particular industry. Open source strategies can now be found in many industries besides technology and their growth is transforming the way modern firms do business.</p>
