"NaN","NaN","155354","<p>I'm running a logistic regression in order to descriptively analyze the relationship between my independent and dependent variables. As I understand it, it's not mathematically necessary to normalize variables in order for the logit model to converge. However, if I want to compare my odds ratios at the end and see which independent variables have the greatest effect, it seems like the variables should all be on the same scale, so I should normalize them. I'm thinking that feature scaling so everything is between the ranges [0,1] would be adequate. Does that make sense?</p>
