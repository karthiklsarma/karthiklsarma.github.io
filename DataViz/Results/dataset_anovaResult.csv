"NaN","NaN"," 11370","<p>I have data from an experiment that is testing how the order of two studying methods (visual or auditory) affects word recall. For analysis a multi-factor anova with a repeated measure is appropriate, but I am not sure if I am structuring my data correctly. </p>

<p>This is the command I'm using:
<code>aov(recalled_items~task*order)+Error(subject/task)+(order))</code></p>

<p>Here is an example of the data structure:</p>

<pre><code>Subject    Task    Order    Recalled Items
A        Visual    First       13
A       Auditory   Second      22
B        Visual    First       14
B       Auditory   Second      28
C        Visual    Second      10
C       Auditory   First       15
D        Visual    Second      14
D       Auditory   First       29
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Does R know to compare Visual 1 and Visual 2 recall values and Auditory 1 and Auditory 2 recall values? </li>
</ul>

<p>I am worried that because of the way I structured my data R is just comparing Visual 1 and Auditory 1 and as a result I am getting no effect.</p>

<p>About Data:</p>

<pre><code>1. Cult - two categories Type 1 and Type 2 (i.e. two varieties)
2. Treatment - Control, CE4, CE8, CE12, CE16 (total 5 groups)
3. Duration_Hrs - observations were notes at 48, 72, 96 and 120 hrs, with 
4. Replication - R1, R2 and R3
5. SL, Rl and AMY are three variables (following above, readings were obtained)

"NaN","NaN"," 94078","<p>Here's the data:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; tires &lt;- data.frame(Wear  = c(17, 14, 12, 13, 14, 14, 12, 11,
                                13, 13, 10, 11, 13, 8, 9, 9),
                      Brand = rep(LETTERS[1:4], 4),
                      Car   = as.character(as.roman(rep(1:4, each = 4))))
&gt; tires
   Wear Brand Car
1    17     A   I
2    14     B   I
3    12     C   I
4    13     D   I
5    14     A  II
6    14     B  II
7    12     C  II
8    11     D  II
9    13     A III
10   13     B III
11   10     C III
12   11     D III
13   13     A  IV
14    8     B  IV
15    9     C  IV
16    9     D  IV
</code></pre>

<p>Now I fit a two-way ANOVA with interaction:</p>

<pre><code>two.way &lt;- aov(Wear ~ Brand + Car + Brand:Car, data = tires)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, no p-values: </p>

<pre><code>&gt; summary(two.way)
            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq
Brand        3  30.69  10.229
Car          3  38.69  12.896
Brand:Car    9  11.56   1.285
</code></pre>

<p>A regular two-way ANOVA (i.e., <code>Wear ~ Brand + Car</code>) gives me p-values:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; summary(aov(Wear ~ Brand + Car, data = tires))
            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(&gt;F)   
Brand        3  30.69  10.229   7.962 0.00668 **
Car          3  38.69  12.896  10.038 0.00313 **
Residuals    9  11.56   1.285

Signif. codes:  0 â€˜***â€™ 0.001 â€˜**â€™ 0.01 â€˜*â€™ 0.05 â€˜.â€™ 0.1 â€˜ â€™ 1
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to interpret this? The interaction plot shows me that there is definitely interaction between <code>Brand</code> and <code>Car</code> so I am hoping to incorporate this into my model.</p>

"NaN","NaN","179992","<p>I have part of the analysis of some data where there are 24 observations all together and I have been given the:</p>

<p>Degrees of freedom, Deviance residuals, Degrees of freedom residuals and deviance</p>

<p>How can I use these to form an ANOVA table ? </p>
