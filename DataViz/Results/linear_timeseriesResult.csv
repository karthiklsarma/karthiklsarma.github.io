<p>I have a set of time-series ""curves"", each measuring the entropy of a given artifact. Now, I'm standing over the following premises (please criticize them as you see fit):</p>

<ol>
<li>In order to approximate the upper bounds of the Kolmogorov complexity $K(s)$, of a string $s$, one can simply compress the string $s$ with some method, implement the corresponding decompressor in the chosen language, concatenate the decompressor to the compressed string, and measure the resulting string's length.</li>
<li>For this purpose, I've used the <em>bzip2</em> application, setting its compression level to the supported maximum (-9).</li>
<li>If one is only interested in a time-series analysis of a set of evolving strings, calculating the compressed <em>deltas</em> is enough to present a relative measure of entropy between any two strings (at least that's my interpretation after reading Cilibrasi05).</li>
<li>For that, I used the <em>diff</em> unix tool, with the (--minimal) parameter, again followed by a <em>bzip2</em> compression, with the aforementioned settings.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm doing this to analyze the evolution of the entropy in a software artifact (code, model, whatever). I'm <em>not</em> worried with the absolute values, but with the <em>relative</em> increase (or decrease) in entropy. Now here comes the problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>I've done this for a set of 6 artifacts, which ought to belong to the same population, but I don't know how to provide statistical evidence of that (the corresponding of doing a two-tailed t-test of two samples).</li>
<li>One of the artifacts evolution <em>should</em> be different from all the others. We're talking something like an exponential v.s. sub-linear growth. How do I provide statistical evidence of that?</li>
</ol>

<p>Again, the disclaimer of being a software engineer. Although I would appreciate every academic reference (papers, books, etc.) you could handle, I'm looking for something pragmatic that I can use in the next few days, like a script in R, or something in SPSS.</p>

<p>P.S. I'm sorry for asking for a <em>recipe</em>, instead of a theoretical explanation.</p>

<p>For the 10 months spread over 2007 and 2008 some of the total deaths from all districts were not recorded. I am trying to estimate these missing value through a multiple imputation method. Either using Generalized Linear Models or SARIMA models.</p>

<p>My biggest issue is the use of software and the coding. I asked a question on Stackoverflow, where I want to extract the data into smaller groups such as this:</p>

<p>But someone suggested I should rather bring my question here - perhaps ask for a direction? Currently I am unable to enter this data as a proper time-series/panel study into R. My eventual aim is to use this data and the <code>amelia2</code> package with its functions to impute for missing <code>TotalDeaths</code> for certain months in 2007 and 2008, where the data is missing.</p>

<p>Any help, how to do this and perhaps suggestions on how to tackle this problem would be gratefully appreciated.</p>

"0.430331482911935","0.419627163708141"," 33405","<p>I'm working with a time-series of several years and to analyze it, Iâ€™m using GAM smoothers from the package <code>mgcv</code>. Iâ€™m constructing models where zooplankton biomass (<code>bm</code>) is the dependent variable and the continuous explanatory variables are: </p>

<p>-time in Julian days (<code>t</code>), to creat a long-term linear trend</p>

<p>-Julian days of the year (<code>t_year</code>) to create an annual cycle</p>

<p>-Mean temperature of Winter (<code>temp_W</code>), Temperature of September (<code>temp_sept</code>) or Chla. </p>

<p>Questions: </p>

<p>1) To introduce a tensor product modifying the annual cycle in my model, I tried 2 different approaches: </p>

<p>a) <code>gam( bm ~ t + te (t_year, temp_W, temp_sept, k = c( 5,30 ), d = ( 1,2), bs = c(  â€œccâ€,â€crâ€ ) ), data = data )</code> </p>

<p>b) <code>gam( bm ~ t + te ( t_year, temp_W, temp_sept, k = 5, bs = c( â€œccâ€,â€crâ€,â€crâ€ ) ), data = data )</code></p>

<p>Here is my problem: when Iâ€™m using just 2 variables (e.g., <code>t_year</code> and <code>temp_W</code>) for the tensor product, I can understand pretty well how the interpolation works and visualize it with <code>vis.gam()</code> as a 3d plot or a contour one. But with 3 variables it is difficult for me  to understand how it works. Besides, I donâ€™t know which one is the proper way to construct it, a) or b). Finally, when I plot a) or b) as <code>vis.gam (model_name , view= c(â€œt_yearâ€, â€œtemp_Wâ€))</code>, How should I interpret the plot? The effect of <code>temp_W</code> on the annual cycle after considering already the effect of <code>temp_sept</code> or just the individual effect of <code>temp_W</code> on the annual cycle?</p>

<p>2) Iâ€™m trying to do a model selection using AIC criteria. I have several questions about it: </p>

<p>Should I use always the same type of smoothing basis (<code>bs</code>), the same type of smoother ( e.g <code>te</code>) and the same dimension of the basis (<code>k</code>)? Example: </p>

<p>Option 1: </p>

<p>a) <code>mod1 &lt;- gam(bm ~ t, data = data )</code></p>

<p>b)<code>mod2 &lt;- gam( bm ~ te ( t, k = 5, bs = â€œcrâ€ ), data = data )</code></p>

<p>c) <code>mod3 &lt;- gam( bm ~ te ( t_year, k = 5, bs = â€œccâ€), data = data )</code></p>

<p>d) <code>mod4 &lt;- gam( bm ~ te ( t_year, temp_W, k = 5, bs = c( â€œccâ€,â€crâ€ ) ), data = data )</code> </p>

<p>e) <code>mod5 &lt;- gam( bm ~ te ( t_year, temp_W, temp_sept, k = 5, bs = c( â€œccâ€,â€crâ€,â€crâ€ ) ), data = data )</code>. </p>

<p>Here the limitation for <code>k = 5</code>, is due to <code>mod5</code>, I donâ€™t use <code>s ()</code> because in <code>mod4</code> and <code>mod5</code> <code>te ()</code> is used and finally, I always use â€œ<code>cr</code>â€ and â€œ<code>cc</code>â€. </p>

<p>Option 2: </p>

<p>a) <code>mod1 &lt;- gam( bm ~ t, data = data )</code></p>

<p>b) <code>mod2 &lt;- gam( bm ~ s ( t, k = 13, bs = â€œcrâ€ ), data = data )</code></p>

<p>c) <code>mod3 &lt;- gam( bm ~ s( t_year, k = 13, bs = â€œccâ€ ), data = data )</code> </p>

<p>d) <code>mod4 &lt;- gam( bm ~ te( t_year, temp_W, k = 11, bs = c( â€œccâ€,â€crâ€ ) ), data = data)</code> </p>

<p>e) <code>mod5 &lt;- gam( bm ~ te( t_year, temp_W, temp_sept, k = 5, bs = c( â€œccâ€,â€crâ€,â€crâ€ ) ), data = data )</code> </p>

<p>I can get lower AIC for each of the models with Option 2, but are they comparable when I use AIC criteria? Is it therefore the proper way to do it as in Option 1? </p>

<p><code>AIC (mod1, mod2, mod3, mod4, mod5)</code>. </p>

<p>I first regressed PPHPY on year and year dummies (leaving the intercept as 0 to avoid perfect multicollinearity). This gave me period effects for the aggregated data (ie something like a period effect across all age groups, I think). This looked like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ## Generate YearDummy using factor()
&gt;
&gt; YearDummy &lt;- factor(YearVar)
&gt;
&gt; ## Check to see that YearDummy is indeed a factor variable
&gt;
&gt; is.factor(YearDummy)
[1] TRUE
&gt;
&gt; ## (...+0) ensures intercept is left out and thus YearDummy1 remains in.
    ## One or the other must be subtracted out to avoid perfect mutlicollinearity

<p>What I want, however, is to tease out period effects for each age group individually. This is what I'm not sure how to set up. I was hoping someone might help me devise some code in R that would kick out those period effects for <em>each</em> of the seven age groups using the pooled data, as well as help me understand the problem conceptually. </p>

<p>EDIT: I forgot to mention that I see I must include an interaction term involving the time dummies to allow the coefficients to vary across age groups. I'm just having difficulty constructing the proper interaction term and resulting regression equation.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I came up with two models and ran them. I felt like the question had evolved at this point and might merit a new post, which is can be found <a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/62755/period-effects-in-pooled-time-series-data-in-r"">here</a>.</p>

"0.384900179459751","0.312771621085612"," 63796","<p>This is related to a <a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/62646/pooled-time-series-regression-in-r"">question</a> I asked a couple weeks ago, but I've got a new question related to the same data. You can find the data and its accompanying explanation in the link provided.</p>

<p>I felt that a regression including year as a covariate along with year dummies would lead to a linear dependence problem, but I was told to try it anyway as </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""the year dummies as independent variables [may] pick up year-specific
  random effects not accounted for by a time trend, e.g. for example the
  trend over all years could be down by say 2 percent per year which
  could apply to most years, but a negative macro shock in one
  particular year could make that year lie way off the regression
  line--a simple example of why the year dummies are not co-linear with
  a time trend.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This makes sense, I suppose, so I ran a regression that simply included year and year dummies for each year as the independent variables (including AR(1) corrections). This looked like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ## Generate YearFactor and AgeGroupFactor using factor()
&gt; 
&gt; YearFactor &lt;- factor(YearVar)
&gt; AgeGroupFactor &lt;- factor(AgeGroup)
&gt; 
&gt; ## Check to see that YearFactor and AgeGroupFactor are indeed factor variables
&gt; 
&gt; is.factor(YearFactor)
[1] TRUE
&gt; is.factor(AgeGroupFactor)
[1] TRUE
&gt;
&gt; ## Run regressions with both time trend and year dummies to determine if a linear dependence problem exists.
&gt; 
&gt; TrendDummies &lt;- gls(PPHPY ~ YearVar + YearFactor, correlation=corARMA(p=1))
Error in glsEstimate(object, control = control) : 
 computed ""gls"" fit is singular, rank 13
&gt; summary(TrendDummies)
Error in summary(TrendDummies) : object 'TrendDummies' not found
&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I interpret the error message ""Error in glsEstimate(object, control = control) : 
     computed ""gls"" fit is singular, rank 13"" to mean that there indeed is a linear dependence problem in this case. Am I properly interpreting this? </p>

<p>Also, given the advice in quotes above, would my regression as constructed (if there were no linear dependence problems) capture the effects mentioned therein?</p>

<p>And finally, if I run the same regression as OLS with no AR(1) correlation structure, I do indeed get some results (instead of an error message). Any thoughts on that?</p>

<p>My question is as follows -- Using R or GRETL, how is it possible to create an ARIMA/TimeSeries model with the above data to predict the SalesCurrent variable. Using simple Linear Regression, one could simply have a formula such as say, <code>lm (SalesCurrent ~ ., data=mytable)</code>, but it would not be a time-series model since it does not take into account the relationship between the different variables.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I am quite familiar with Machine Learning models and wanted to get your thoughts on how such a dataset could be modeled using say, randomForest, GBM, etc. </p>

Beside seasonality, there is no clear long-term trend in the data. My purpose is to see which variables are related to each other. Forecasting is not really looked for. </p>

<p>Being new to time-series analysis, I read several references. As far as I understand, Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model would be appropriate, but I donâ€™t feel comfortable with seasonality and most examples I found concerned economics field (as often with time series analysisâ€¦) without seasonality.</p>

<p>What should I do with my seasonal data?
I considered deseasonalizing them â€“ for example in R, I would use <code>decompose</code> and then use the <code>$trend + $rand</code> values to obtain a signal which appears pretty stationary (as judged per <code>acf</code>).
Results of the VAR model are confusing me (a 1-lag model is selected while I would have intuitively expected more, and only coefficients for autoregression â€“ and not for regression with other lagged variables - are significant). 
Am I doing anything wrong, or should I conclude that my variables are not (linearly) related / my model is not the good one (subsidiary question: is there a non-linear equivalent to VAR?).</p>

<p>[Alternatively, I read I could probably use dummy seasonal variables, though I canâ€™t figure out exactly how to implement it].</p>

<p>Step-by-step suggestions would be very appreciated, since details for experienced users might actually be informative to me (and R code snippets or links towards concrete examples are very welcome, of course). Thank you.</p>

<p>My question is regarding the confidence intervals shown in this plot. I calculate <em>my own</em> confidence intervals using the standard method (my C# code is below)</p>

<pre><code>public static double ConfidenceInterval(
    IEnumerable&lt;double&gt; samples, double interval)
{
    Contract.Requires(interval &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; interval &lt; 1.0);

    int sampleSize = samples.Count();
    double alpha = 1.0 - interval;
    double mean = samples.Mean();
    double sd = samples.StandardDeviation();

    var student = new StudentT(0, 1, samples.Count() - 1);
    double T = student.InverseCumulativeDistribution(theta);
    return T * (sd / Math.Sqrt(samples.Count()));
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now this will return a single interval (and it does it correctly) which I will add/subtract from each point on the series I have applied the calculation to to give me my confidence interval. But this is a constant and the R implementation seems to change over the time-series.</p>

<p>My question is why is <strong>the confidence interval changing for the R implementation? Should I be implementing my confidence levels/intervals differently?</strong></p>

"0.272165526975909","0.294883912309794","148920","<p>I'm trying to build an artificial neural network (ANN) using the R ""neuralnet"" package, to predict streamflow from snow albedo (reflectance of the snow; controls the amount of heat absorbed by the snow, and therefore controls its melt), precipitation, air temperature, and a temporal variable, 'day of the year'. All the above variables are time-series with 4383 values each between the years 2002 and 2013, with daily temporal frequency. Simpler statistical models have not worked because of the complex autocorrelated and lagged relationship between the predictor and predictors.</p>

<p>I have the following questions about building the ANN:</p>

<ol>
<li>What number of hidden layers should I use when building the model? How does this choice affect the model?</li>
<li>Should I change the 'threshold' parameter from the default (0.01)? My flow values fluctuate between 0.5 and 134.82 cubic-foot per second (cfs), with a mean of 8.5 cfs. Ideally, my flow prediction errors should not be greater than 1-2 cfs.</li>
<li>Will the choice of algorithm affect the prediction accuracy?</li>
<li>Should I change any of the other parameters in neuralnet?</li>
<li>Should I include any other variables (lags, temporal variables etc) in my model?</li>
</ol>

<p>Also, would any other machine learning or statistical method be more suitable for this task? My data is highly non-linear, with some seasonality every year, and PACF and CCF plots indicate lags at all lag periods between -30 and +30 days.</p>

<p>I would be happy to answer any questions about the data, or about what I've already tried (GAMs, GLMs, Decision Trees and Random Forests).
Thank you. </p>

<p>This does train the model, but the error is really high, and when I use it to do any computation the results of the second layer neuron is alway 1.

<p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/hb3g7j17igeqnoc/dat.csv?dl=0"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> is a link to my raw data.</p>

<p>I have a complex time-series of daily incidence numbers for a population over 7 years, totaling 2557 observations. There is a strong weekly and yearly seasonality (high incidence in winter months and low incidence in summer months). There is a baseline negative trend which is orders of magnitude smaller than the seasonality. An intervention was introduced at time = 1700. This intervention should theoretically not cause a level shift. My aim is to detect whether the intervention increases the baseline negative trend.</p>

<p>I have attempted to fit a dynamic linear regression with ARIMA errors in R using <code>auto.arima()</code> in the <code>forecast</code> package. I modeled the weekly season using a dummy variable for each weekday and the weekend. I modeled the monthly seasonality with harmonics using <code>fourier()</code> function in the <code>forecast</code> package. An the intervention effect was coded in by specifying the time index and post-intervention times as independent variables using the methods described in <a href=""http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic79832.files/L06_Program_Evaluation_2/Segmented_Regression.Wagner.2002.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">Segmented regression analysis of interrupted time series studies in medication use research</a>. With these variables specified <code>auto.arima()</code> suggests an ARMA(7,7) process. The coefficients for baseline trend and post-intervention trend are however non-significant.  </p>

<p>I am concerned that by using fourier terms to model away the seasonality I am artificially removing any intervention effect, as visual analysis of the time series indicates that the intervention is specifically decreasing incidence during the winter months and therefore reducing the yearly seasonal variability. </p>

"0.384900179459751","0.364900224599881","196901","<p>I'm trying to figure out how to find the marginal effect of an interaction term from a restricted cubic spline in a non-linear model.  The post <a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/134526/nonlinear-effect-in-an-interaction-term"">Nonlinear effect in an interaction term</a> is a good start on modeling the nonlinear effects and how to get plots, but does not address finding the marginal effect.  </p>

<p>The package <a href=""http://maartenbuis.nl/software/postrcspline.html"" rel=""nofollow"">postrcspline</a> in <code>STATA</code> has a function <a href=""http://repec.org/bocode/m/mfxrcspline.html"" rel=""nofollow"">mfxrcspline</a> which ""displays the marginal effect of a restricted cubic spline,""
 which is exactly what I am after. (See Figure 1 below)  </p>

<p>R does not seem to offer this feature as conveniently ,so I'm trying to figure out how to get these same results.</p>

<p>As I understand it, suppose I have a multi-variable regression with restricted cubic splines and an interaction:</p>

<p>$$y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x1 + \beta_{2} \mathcal{f}(x2) + \beta_{3} \mathcal{f}(x2) \cdot x1 + \epsilon$$</p>

<p>where $\mathcal{f}(x2)$ is a spline of the time-series (year)</p>

<p>The marginal effect of $\frac{\partial y}{\partial x1}$ is:</p>

<p>$$\frac{\partial y}{\partial x1} = \beta_{1} + \beta_{3} \mathcal{f}(x2)$$</p>

<p>where $\beta_{3}$ is the coefficient on the spline and $ \mathcal{f}(x2)$ is a design matrix for each year in the regression that causes the slope to change for each $y$.  </p>

<p>To say in words, I would like to find the marginal effect of $y$ for each year $x2$ in the spline given $\beta_{3}$.  </p>

<p>In other words, it shows for each value of the spline variable how much the expected value of your explained variable changes for a unit change in the spline variable. It is the first derivative of the curve.</p>

<p>This appears to be simple matrix multiplication to plot the marginal effect, but I'm not sure how to statistically do this.  </p>

<p>Here is a plot to illustrate what I'm after:</p>

<p><strong>Figure 1:</strong> The left plot shows the results of the regression using a restricted cubic spline and the right provides the marginal effect--note the changes on the y-axis.

<p><strong>Analyses done in R using nlme() package</strong></p>

<p><strong>Models:</strong> I tried a number of <code>gls</code> models and selected models that had lower AICs to move forward with. I also checked the significance of adding predictors based on ANOVA. It turns out that including time (centered around 1950), month (as a factor), and PDO (Pacific Decadal Oscillation) trend data create the 'best' model (i.e., the one with the lowest AIC and in which each predictor improves the model significantly). Interestingly, using season (as a factor) performed worse than using month; additionally, no interactions were significant or improved the model. The best model is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>mod1 &lt;- gls(temp.avg ~ I(year-1950) + factor(month) + pdo, data = df)

<p><strong>My Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it even appropriate to use an ARMA correlation here?</p>

<ul>
<li>I assume that any inferences from a simple linear model (e.g., <code>lm(temp ~ year)</code>) are inappropriate b/c of other underlying correlation structure (even though this simple linear trend <em>is</em> what I'm most interested in.</li>
<li><p>I assume by removing affects of time lags (i.e. autocorrelation), I can better 'see' if there is in fact a long term temporal trend (incline/decline)?</p>

<ul>
<li>Is this the correct way to think about this?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Concerning year becoming non-significant in the model...</p>

<ul>
<li>Would this have occurred because <em>all</em> of the temporal trend turned out to be due to autocorrealtion and therefore is now otherwise being accounted for in the model?</li>
<li><p>Do I remove time from my model now (since it's no longer a significant predictor)??</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I did do this, and the resulting model had a lower AIC (4291 vs 4300 of mod2 above). </p></li>
<li><p>Though this isn't really a useful step for me, because I'm actually concerned about a trend in temp due to <em>time</em> (i.e., year) itself. </p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Interpretation -- Am I interpreting the results correctly??:</p>

<ul>
<li>So based on the <code>summary</code> output above for mod2, is it correct to assume the answer to my original scientific question is: ""temperature has declined at a rate of -0.005929, but this decline is not significant (p = 0.5067)."" ??</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Next steps...</p>

<ul>
<li>I ultimately want to see if temperature will have an impact on tree-community time-series data. My motivation behind the procedure mentioned here was to determine if there was a trend in temperature before bothering to start including it in subsequent analyses.</li>
<li>So as performed, I assume I can now say that there is not a significant linear change (increase/decline) in temp. This would suggest that perhaps temp is not important to include in subsequent analyses?</li>
<li>However...perhaps the cyclic nature of the temp <em>is</em> important and drives cyclic patterns in the plant data. How would I approach this? (i.e., how do I 'correlate' the cyclic trend in temp with potential cyclic trend in plants' -- vs. simply <em>removing</em> cyclic (seasonal) trends based on the ACF results)? </li>
</ul></li>

"0.45133546692422","0.444554224474387","198315","<p>I am currently getting slightly confused with how a rolling forecast should be setup in R, as in how the data should be organised in order to <em>train</em> and <em>test</em> my model. I feel there is a large gap in my understanding somewhere.</p>

<p>I have seen many examples of forecasting methods, but not many on time-series (using lagged variables) that go into detail, i.e. perform everything manually using <code>predict()</code>. Instead it normally just points to a built in R package. <strong>My question has to do with the training of the model - the alignment of the data for the training.</strong></p>

<p>I know that the regression equation (assuming I am performing a linear regression) looks like this:</p>

<p>$$ y_t = \beta_1 y_{t-1} + \beta_2 y_{t-2} + \beta_3 x_{t-1} + \beta_4 x_{t-2} + \varepsilon_t $$ </p>

<p>So I have my outcome variable, $y$, being explained by two of its own lagged values, plus two lagged values of a second variable, $x$. Each variable has its own coefficient, all of which my model is estimating.</p>

<p>Let's say I have a <em>data.table</em> (or data.frame), where each row consists of the data aligned according to the equation above. Each row is one day, and represents the given equation. I have five columns, and for this example say 200 rows/days.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Day  |  $y_t$  |  $y_{t-1}$  |  $y_{t-2}$  |  $x_{t-1}$  |  $x_{t-2}$</p>
  
  <p>001  | <em>Values</em> --></p>
  
  <p>002  | <em>Values</em> --></p>
  
  <p>003  | <em>Values</em> --></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I use the above equation as the formula to fit my model to obtain estimates for the four coefficients (neglecting $\varepsilon$) using a fixed 40-day time frame.</p>

<pre><code>model &lt;- lm(y ~ y_1 + y_2 + x_1, x_2,            ## my regression formula
            data = input_data[1:40])             ## my data.table 
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to make a prediction using the fitted <code>model</code>.
I do this by using <code>predict()</code> in <strong>R</strong> as follows:
I take the next (41st) row of data, minus the outcome variable</p>

<pre><code>my_pred &lt;- predict(model, newdata = input_data[41][, outcome := NULL])
</code></pre>

<p>And then calculate my error:</p>

<pre><code>my_error &lt;- input_data[41, outcome] - my_pred
</code></pre>

<p>I then shift everything forward one row, so still a 40-day frame <code>input_data[2:41]</code> updating the coefficients for all variables and predicting the following outcome variable, <code>input_data[42]</code>. This is yielding terrible results for my model, with overall accuracies not much better than a naÃ¯ve forecast, i.e. random guessing.</p>

<p>Should I realign the data for the training segment, so that each row rather represents the data I had on that day? This would mean adding one more column, $x_t$.</p>

<p>Any other suggestions or comments?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

"0.304290309725092","0.329690236697893","223379","<p>I'm fitting an <code>arima</code>(1,0,0) model using the <code>forecast</code> package in R on the <code>usconsumption</code> dataset.
