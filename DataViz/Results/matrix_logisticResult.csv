"NaN","NaN","156610","<p>Whenever I run a logistic regression, I need to set the threshold so that it groups probabilities higher than the threshold to my positive group:</p>

<pre><code>table(test$Noshow, logpred&gt;0.5)
</code></pre>

<p>What I sometimes do is to optimize my confusion matrix so that I get a good Sensitivity and Specificity values. Is this a good way to do it?</p>

<p>On the other hand, when I run a randomForest model using the ""randomForest"" package, I can set the cutoffs such as this:</p>

<pre><code>k &lt;- 0.5
rfcutoff &lt;- c(k, 1-k)
rftree &lt;- randomForest(rffrmla_all, data = train1, mtry = 2, keep.forest = TRUE, importance = TRUE, ntree = 500, cutoff = rfcutoff)
</code></pre>

<p>Again I optimize my confusion matrix to get a good cutoff or base the cutoff on a naive baseline proportion. What is a good way to do this? </p>
