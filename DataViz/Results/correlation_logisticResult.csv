<p>i.e. two years of observations, one per day, of a psychiatric ward, which indicate whether there was a violence incident on that day (1 is yes, 0 no) as well as the number of patients on the ward. The hypothesis that we wish to test is that more patients on the ward is associated with an increased probability of violence on the ward.</p>

<p>We realise, of course, that we will have to adjust for the fact that when there are more patients on the ward, violence is more likely because there are just more of them- we are interested in whether each individualâ€™s probability of violence goes up when there are more patients on the ward.</p>

<p>I've seen several papers which just use logistic regression, but I think that is wrong because there is an autoregressive structure (although, looking at the autocorrelation function, it doesnâ€™t get above .1 at any lag, although this is above the â€œsignificantâ€ blue dashed line that R draws for me).</p>

<p>Just to make things more complicated, I can if I wish to break down the results into individual patients, so the data would look just as it does above, except I would have the data for each patient, 1/1/2008, 2/1/2008 etc. and an ID code going down the side so the data would show the whole history of incidents for each patient separately (although not all patients are present for all days, not sure whether that matters).</p>

<p>I would like to use lme4 in R to model the autoregressive structure within each patient, but some Googling comes up with the quotation â€œlme4 is not set up to deal with autoregressive structuresâ€. Even if it were, Iâ€™m not sure I grasp how to write the code anyway.</p>

<p>Just in case anyone notices, I asked a question like this a while ago, they are different datasets with different problems, although actually solving this problem will help with that one (someone suggested I use mixed methods previously, but this autoregression thing has made me unsure how to do this).</p>

<p>So Iâ€™m a bit stuck and lost to be honest. Any help gratefully received!</p>

<p>Armitage used logistic regression but I wonder if it's possible to use a model from the survival package, the <a href=""http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survivalROC/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">survivalROC</a> gives a hint of this being possible but I can't figure out how to get that to work with a regular Cox regression. </p>

<p>I would be grateful if someone would show me how to do a ROC-analysis on this example:</p>

<pre><code>library(survival)

<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>Thank you very much for answers. @Dwin: I would just like to be sure that I've understood it right before selecting your answer. </p>

<p>The calculation as I understand it according to DWin's suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>library(survival)
library(rms)
data(veteran)

fit.cph &lt;- cph(surv ~ trt + age + prior, data=veteran, x=TRUE, y=TRUE, surv=TRUE)

# Summary fails!?
#summary(fit.cph)

# Get the Dxy
v &lt;- validate(fit.cph, dxy=TRUE, B=100)
# Is this the correct value?
Dxy = v[rownames(v)==""Dxy"", colnames(v)==""index.corrected""]

# The c-statistic according to the Dxy=2(c-0.5)
Dxy/2+0.5
</code></pre>

<p>I'm unfamiliar with the validate function and bootstrapping but after looking at prof. Frank Harrel's answer <a href=""http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Interpreting-the-example-given-by-Prof-Frank-Harrell-in-Design-validate-cph-tt3316820.html#a3324516"" rel=""nofollow"">here on R-help</a> I figured that it's probably the way to get the Dxy. The help for validate states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... Somers' Dxy rank correlation to be computed at each resample (this
  takes a bit longer than the likelihood based statistics). The values
  corresponting to the row Dxy are equal to 2 * (C - 0.5) where C is the
  C-index or concordance probability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess I'm mostly confused by the columns. I figured that the corrected value is the one I should use but I haven't really understood the validate output:</p>

"0.199204768222399","0.2"," 76490","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>A laboratory wants to evaluate whether a certain form of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyacrylamide_gel_electrophoresis"" rel=""nofollow"">gel electrophoresis</a> is suited as a classification method for the quality of a certain substance. Several gels were loaded, each with a clean sample of the substance and with a sample that contains impurities. In addition, a molecular marker was also loaded which serves as a reference. The following picture illustrates the setup (the picture doesn't show the actual experiment, I have taken it from Wikipedia for illustration):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/vC53q.png"" alt=""Example of a gel electrophoresis""></p>

<p>Two parameters were measured for each gel and each lane:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <strong>molecular weight</strong> (that is how ""high up"" a compound wandered during the electrophoresis)</li>
<li>The <strong>relative quantity.</strong> The total quantity of each lane is normalized to 1 and the density of each band is measured which results in the relative quantity of each band.</li>
</ol>

<p>A scatterplot of the relative quantity vs. molecular weight is then produced which could look something like this (it's artificial data):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ndzh9.png"" alt=""Example scatterplot""></p>

<p>This graphic can be read as follows: Both the ""good"" (blue points) and ""impure"" (red points) substance exhibit two bands, one at around a molecular weight of 120 and one at around 165. The bands of the ""impure"" substance at a molecular weight around 120 are considerably less dense than the ""good"" substance and can be well distinguished.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>The goal is to determine two boxed (see graphic below) which determine a ""good"" substance. These boxes will then be used for classification of the substance in the future into ""good"" and ""impure"". If a substance exhibits lanes that fall within the boxes it is classified as ""good"" and else as ""impure"".</p>

<p>These decision-rules should be <em>simple</em> to apply for someone in the laboratory. That's why it should be boxes instead of curved decision boundaries.</p>

<p>False-negatives (i.e. classify a sample as ""impure"" when it's really ""good"") are considered worse than false-positives. That is, an emphasis should be placed on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity#Sensitivity"" rel=""nofollow"">sensitivity</a>, rather than on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity#Specificity"" rel=""nofollow"">specificity</a>.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>I'm am no expert in machine learning. I know, however, that there are quite a few machine learning algorithms/techniques that could be helpful: $k$-nearest neighbors (e.g. <code>knn</code> in <code>R</code>), classification trees (e.g. <code>rpart</code> or <code>ctree</code>), support vector machines (<code>ksvm</code>), logistic regression, boosting and bagging methods and many more.</p>

<p>One problem of many of those algorithms is that they don't provide a simple ruleset or linear boundaries. In addition, the <strong>sample size</strong> is around <strong>70.</strong></p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Has anyone an idea of how to proceed here?</li>
<li>Does it make sense to split the dataset into training- and test-set?</li>
<li>What proportion of the data should the training set be (I thought around a 60/40-split).</li>
<li>What, in general, is the workflow for such an analysis? Something like: Splitting dataset -> fit algorithm on the training set -> predict outcome for the test set?</li>
<li>How to avoid overfitting (i.e. boxes that are too small)?</li>
<li>What is a good statistic to assess the predictive performance in this case? AUC? Accurary? Positive predictive value? <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthews_correlation_coefficient"" rel=""nofollow"">Matthews correlation coefficient</a>?</li>
</ul>

<p>My only guess on this is that the previous support scores (both 0-100 numerical values) I'm using may have already taken age into account, and the model doesn't want to count it twice. Though, to compare, region and county are just two different ways of cutting up the geography -- and those both seem significant.</p>

<p>Can somebody let me know what you would think if your model told you that age wasn't significant when in clearly is? Trying to figure out if there's a way of thinking about it that I'm missing or if something in my code is wrong.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<h3>Problem Background</h3>

<p>A user posts a request on a forum. Considering number of responses / number of up votes / users' reputation / etc., can you predict if the request will be fulfilled? There are about 4000 rows of test data available.</p>

<h3>Current Attempts</h3>

<p>I have created basic graphs to investigate correlation, and applied a few transformations to the data. 
I have decided to go with logistic regression, and based on the graphs, have chosen 2 factors for the initial model. </p>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>I have created the basic model using R, and I can see some summary stats, but I am a bit lost when I try to understand (a) How well the model fits the data and (b) whether the model is accurate. I tried Googling around, but most of the articles were too technical for me. Is there a cheat sheet/quick test of some sort that I can apply? Or can somebody suggest the simplest ""complicated"" article?</p>

"0.30952380952381","0.33466401061363","112670","<p>I'm working on a dataset with the following variables:</p>

<pre><code>Y:  a boolean telling whether the subject has experienced a seizure
ID:  the id of the subject
Sess:  the subject's session number (a subject has been observed multiple times)
X3:  numeric measurements of the subject's behavior during the session 
X4:  ""
X6:  ""
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is to see if the behavior measurements(X3,X4,X6) can be used predict the Seizure status (Y) in the population.  If there were just one session per subject I'd model the data with a logistic regression, but since each subject has multiple sessions the observations cannot be assumed independent.</p>

<p>It seems a GEE logistic model makes the most sense for this dataset, but I'm having trouble understanding the results when compared to a regular glm.  When introducing correlation structure to the GEE equation the signs of the coefficients are reversed, and the predicted values are opposite of what they would be with an independent correlation structure.</p>

<pre><code>library(""geepack"")
#regular logistic model
mod0 = glm(Y~X3+X4+X6, family=binomial(""logit""), data=mice)
#gee logistic model, independent correlation structure

<p>In this case I have two dependent variables (1. Extrovert, 2. Introvert).

I also have some questions such as : </p>

<ol>
<li>I use the different type of variables, independent variables (data type : numeric) but dependent variable (data type is categorical), so it is possible to apply logistic regression and Pearson? </li>

"0.295468420142639","0.269679944985297","114728","<p>I'm trying to run a QAP logistic regression to predict the odds of a tie in a social network (represented as a binary adjacency matrix) given two independent variables (also binary matrices) but am getting opposite results depending on whether I run the analysis in R or UCINET.</p>

<p>All three matrices are rectangular (30 x 75). The 30 rows are people I've interviewed and the 75 columns are the entire population (including the 30 interviewees). All matrices include the person IDs as row and column names.</p>

<p>Running the analysis in R (see code at the bottom of the question), I get the following output:</p>

<pre><code>            Estimate  Exp(b)       Pr(&lt;=b) Pr(&gt;=b) Pr(&gt;=|b|)

<p>Any ideas why this might be happening?</p>

<p>In case it's important, the (QAP) correlation coefficient between the two independent variables is 0.382</p>

<p>I've only included the 30 interviewees in the matrix rows because they are the only people from whom there might be a tie. The networks and QAP regressions are directed.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if I run the QAP logit using full 75x75 adjacency matrices (all people in the columns also appear as rows), I get the same output in both programs.</p>

<p>I also have a related question... A colleague suggested I could run the analysis using the 75x75 matrices but replace the rows of people I haven't interviewed with NAs. This gives me the same results in R and UCINET. Does this seem like a sensible approach, rather than using rectangular matrices?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Reproducible example in R:</p>

<p>The differences with the ""call"" part is due to the fact I translated some words.</p>

<p>I think I understand the relation between the random intercept and the random slope for linear regressions but it is more difficult for logistics ones. I guess that when the correlation is positive, I can conclude that the type of neighborhood (social context) has a positive impact on the protectiveness of friendship ties, and conversely. But how do I quantify that ?</p>

<p>Moreover, I find it odd to get correlation of 1 or -1 and nothing more intermediate.</p>

<p>As for the ICC I am puzzled because I have seen a post about lmer regression that indicates that intraclass correlation can be computed by dividing the variance of the random intercept by the variance of the random intercept, plus the variance the random variables, plus the residuals. </p>

<p>But there are no residuals in the results of a glmer. I have read in a book that ICC must be computed by dividing the random intercept variance by the random intercept variance plus 2.36 (piÂ²/3). But in another book, 2.36 was replaced by the inter-group variance (the first level variance I guess). 
What is the good solution ?</p>

<p>I hope these questions are not too confused.

"0.199204768222399","0.2","115637","<p>I have a reasonably large dataset (d) with predictor variables x1...xn and a target variable y. I can use recursive partitioning (such as CART or rpart in R) to find subsets of d with a high (or low) average y. However, I am interested in subsets with a high <strong>correlation</strong> between x1 and y. For example, suppose that in the subset defined by d[x2>5 &amp; x3&lt;7], the linear model y = a*x1 + b has an r^2 of 90%, which I will call 'high.' I am looking for an algorithm that will take in dataset d, find the subset d[x2>5 &amp; x3&lt;7] (as well as others that would produce a high r^2 using the linear model), and give me, as output, the list of subsets found and the r^2 of each. Just like in recursive partitioning, this algo would look for subsets as large as possible, and try to arrive at them using as few 'steps' or 'cuts' as possible (e.g. d[x2>5 &amp; x3&lt;7] would be two 'cuts')</p>

<p>In an ideal world, I would even get to specify the model - i.e. instead of using a linear model y = a*x1 + b, I would like to use a logistic model, since y is binary in my particular dataset.</p>

<p>Is there an algorithm that can find those subsets for me automatically? Is this algorithm perchance implemented in R?</p>

"0.218217890235992","0.219089023002066","122039","<p><strong>SOLVED</strong>: an elastic net model, as any other logistic regression model, will not generate more coefficients than input variables. Check Zach's answer to understand how from an (apparent) low number of inputs, more coefficients can be generated. The cause of this question was a code bug, as the users pointed out.</p>

<p>This is a simple question. I've fitted a model with 1334 variables using elastic net to perform feature selection and regularization. I'm now trying to interpret the obtained coefficients in order to find correlations between the input variables and the output. The only problem is that instead of the (expected) 1335 coefficients (intercept+1334), extracting the coefficients through <code>coef(model,s=""lambda.min"")</code> yields around 1390 coefficients. This seems highly counterintuitive and stops me from mapping a single coefficient to a single input variable, so I suppose I'm not understanding some of the insides of the elastic net. Any idea would be very helpful. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>PS: just in case someone wonders so, I've not included interaction terms nor any synthetic variable, just the original 1334 ones.</p>

<p>PS3: about the code used to fit the model:</p>

<p>it is a 250 line script, so unless you specifically need it, I think it'd only clutter the question. Basically, the algorithm takes as an input a data frame of 1393 colums, where the last one is the target variable and the first 1392 are the input variables. So, after separating those into two matrices, input and output, the actual model fitting is done in this call:</p>

<p><code>cv.glmnet(x=input_matrix,y=output_matrix,family=""binomial"",type.measure=""auc"")</code></p>

<p>If you need to, I can actually generate a reproducible file with the data I use and the whole script. </p>

<p>That is, if I run a model on a dataset, I get certain estimate for my fixed effect and it has a certain p-value.  I run the model again, and I get the same estimate and p-value.  Now, I shuffle the order of rows (the data is not mixed, just the rows are in a different order).  Running the model a third time, the p-value is very different.</p>

<p>For the data I have, the estimated p-value for the fixed effect can be between p=0.001 and p=0.08.  Obviously, these are crucial differences given conventional significance levels. </p>

<p>I understand that the estimates are just estimated, and there will be differences between values for a number of reasons.  However, the magnitude of the differences for my data seem large to me, and I wouldn't expect the order of my dataframe to have this effect (we discovered this problem by chance when a colleague ran the same model but got different results.

<p>I'm afraid that I can't attach the data due to privacy reasons. </p>

<p>Both models converge.  The difference appears to be in the standard errors, while the differences in coefficient estimates are smaller.  The model fit (AIC etc.) are the same, so maybe there are multiple optimal convergences, and the order of the data pushes the optimiser into different ones.  However, I get slightly different estimates every time I shuffle the data frame (not just two or three unique estimates).  In one case (not shown above), the model did not converge simply because of a shuffling of the rows.</p>

<p>I suspect that the problem lies with the structure of my particular data.  It's reasonably large (nearly 200,000 cases), and has nested random effects.  I have tried centering the data, using contrast coding and feeding starting values to lmer based on a previous fit.  This seems to help somewhat, but I still get reasonably large differences in p-values.  I also tried using different ways of calculating p-values, but I got the same problem.</p>

<p>Below, I've tried to replicate this problem with synthesised data.  The differences here aren't as big as with my real data, but it gives an idea of the problem.</p>

<pre><code>library(lme4)
set.seed(999)

# make a somewhat complex data frame
x = c(rnorm(10000),rnorm(10000,0.1))
x = sample(x)
y = jitter(x,amount=10)
a = rep(1:20,length.out=length(x))
y[a==1] = jitter(y[a==1],amount=3)
y[a==2] = jitter(x[a==2],amount=1)
y[a&gt;3 &amp; a&lt;6] = rnorm(sum(a&gt;3 &amp; a&lt;6))
# convert to binary variables
y = y &gt;0
x = x &gt;0
# make a data frame
d = data.frame(x1=x,y1=y,a1=a)

# run model 
m1 = glmer(x1~y1+(1+y1|a1),data=d,family=binomial(link='logit'))

# shuffle order of rows
d = d[sample(nrow(d)),]

# run model again
m2 = glmer(x1~y1+(1+y1|a1),data=d,family=binomial(link='logit'))

# show output

<p>One solution to this is to run the model multiple times with different row orders, and report the range of p-values.  However, this seems inelegant and potentially quite confusing.</p>

<p>The problem does not affect model comparison estimates (using anova), since these are based on differences in model fit.  The fixed effect coefficient estimates are also reasonably robust.  Therefore, I could just report the effect size, confidence intervals and the p-value from a model comparison with a null model, rather than the p-values from within the main model.</p>

<p>Anyway, has anyone else had this problem?  Any advice on how to proceed?</p>

<p>I need to discretize the continuous variables (for logistic regression) with respect to the target variable and with the constrained that the frequency of observation in each interval should be balanced. I tried machine learning algorithms like Chi Merge, decision trees. Chi merge gave me intervals with very unbalanced numbers in each interval (an interval with 3 observations and another one with 1000). The decision trees were hard to interpret.</p>

<p>I came to the conclusion that an optimal discretization should maximise the $\chi^2$ statistic between the discretized variable and the target variable and should have intervals containing roughly the same amount of observations. </p>

<p>Is there an algorithm for solving this?</p>

<p>This how it could look like in R (def is the target variable and x the variable to be discretized).

"0.218217890235992","0.219089023002066","179751","<p>In generating a logistic regression model for a data set of c.8000 observations over c.40 variables (not including interactions) I am trying to figure the relations between the variables. Most variables are binary. 
The purpose is to be able to combine different variables which explains the same variance in the data. 
I have done some web-research of different possibilities but have found their contribution to the process somehow limited. Most of the 2x2 tests points out their is significantly no correlation between any of the pairs. The reason is, as I understand it, that the numbers are relatively big, for instance:</p>

<p>It seems like their is some kind of correlation between both sets though due to the big data sets differences are significant. </p>

<p>Is there any suggestion of how to capture even low value correlations between binary variables? or other ways to understand these relations? </p>

<p>504 individuals were all sampled 2 times. Once before and once after a celebration.</p>

<p>The goal is to investigate if this event (Celebration) as well as working with animals (sheepdog) have an influence on the probability that an individual gets infected by a parasite. (out of 1008 observations only 22 are found to be infected)</p>

<li>""Area"" (geographical area = 4 levels)</li>
<li>""InfectionPeriodT_hydat"" (continuous --> Nr Days after deworming"")</li>
<li>""Urbanisation (3 levels)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Question 1:</h2>

<p>1) Should I include Individual-ID (""ID"") as a random Effekt as I sampled each Ind. 2 times? (Pseudoreplication?) </p>

<pre><code>mod_fail &lt;- glmer( T_hydat ~ Celebration + Sex + RelAge + SheepDog + InfectionPeriodT_hydat + Urbanisation + (1|ID), family = binomial)

<p>--> unfortunately this model fails to converge (is it a problem that ID = 504 levels with only 2 observations per level?) 
Convergence is achieved with glmmPQL() but after droping some unsignficant preditiv variables the model fails to converge again ? What is the Problem here? Could geeglm() be a solution?</p>

<p>In an other attempt I run the model only with ""Area"" (4 levels) as random effect (my expectation is that Ind. in the same geogr. Area are suffering from the same parasite pressure etc.) and received the follwoing p-Values. </p>

"0.220479275922049","0.25298221281347","204145","<p><strong>Background and Problem</strong></p>

<p>I have a question concerning a meta-analysis combining effects from between- and within-subject designs using log-odds ratios (OR) as the metric of interest. I am familiar with conducting meta-analyses and will be undertaking my calculations in R (using the <code>metafor</code> and <code>lme4</code> packages). To provide greater context, the studies in question ask research subjects to make a binary decision with respect to a personal preference across one of two conditions. In some cases, each participant is assigned to a single condition (making only a single binary response); in others, each subject takes part in both conditions (making two binary responses). For now, presume I have the raw data in all cases. The issue I face is how best to calculate an OR that is comparable across design and whether I should take the correlation between conditions into account for the within-subject designs.</p>

<p><strong>My Current Approach</strong></p>

<p>I presently use logistic regression to estimate the OR for between-subject designs. The slope represents the OR and the sampling variance can be calculated by squaring the SE of the slope coefficient. Using this approach produces estimates comparable to equations reported in common texts such The Handbook of Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis, 2nd Edition (p. 243). I then extend this approach to use a multilevel logistic regression model including a random intercept by subject to estimate the OR for within-subject designs while account for the dependency between conditions. The OR and sampling variance are otherwise calculated in the same fashion. </p>

<p><strong>My Questions:</strong></p>

<p>With this in mind, I would like to ask:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is it reasonable to meta-analytically aggregate OR calculated using standard and multilevel logistic regression?</li>
<li>Would it be better to use standard logistic regression for both designs (ignoring the correlation between conditions for the within-subject designs)?</li>

I know that after the fit I should check residual plot, normality assumptions, etc. etc. but nonetheless I find really strange this behaviour.</p>

<p>Edit:
The <code>rating</code> variable is not really an ordinal one, so as pointed out by @Scortchi maybe it would be better to treat it as a categorical one.
I have surely better results and model stability, obviously the model is a simple one and the residual error would be always high (because some variables as not been included in the model).
Indeed, including the frequency table as requested shows that the rating variable IS NOT sufficient for having a clear separation between the result outcome.</p>

Within my dataset (N=2,400), I have one IV (call it â€˜dsâ€™) with 2 levels that differentiates which dataset the workers labeled. I have four factors of interest (what workers labeled) -- these are my DVs (let's call them f1, f2, f3, f4). Three of those factors are binomial &lt;0,1>, and one multinomial &lt;0, 1, 2>. Even though the latter can be treated as ordinal, I'm working under the assumption it is nominal. Finally, my datasets are of unequal lengths.</p>

<p>My goal is to analyze the relationship between each of the labeled factors for each level of the IV. More specifically, <strong>I want to tease out the different contributions of each of those factors on each dataset quantitatively, i.e., show amount of variance explained</strong> (e.g., ds1 influenced f1 more than f2, while the inverse for ds2). The end game is to model each factor into a scoring function, which allows me to compute a unified score. Hence, I need to back up the parameter weights for this function.</p>

<p>A snippet of my data frame looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>   f1 f2 f3 f4 ds
1   1  0  1  0  1
2   0  0  0  2  1
3   0  0  1  1  2
4   1  1  0  2  2
</code></pre>

<p>What I initially did was to compute correlations between each factor, and used the strengths of those correlations to back up my scoring function. However, given the many posts and tutorials I've been reading, it seems I need to make use of a mix of logistic and multinomial regression. What I have done so far is run binomial logit (using ?glm with class â€˜binomial') on the first 3 factors, and multinomial regression (using ?nnet) on f4. However, it seems I can only assess one outcome variable at a time.</p>

<p>For f1-f3, I have run the following R code:</p>

<pre><code>fit &lt;- glm(f1 ~ ds, data = xx, family = ""binomial"")
summary(fit)
confint.default(fit)
wald.test(b = coef(fit), Sigma = vcov(fit), Terms = 2)
</code></pre>

<p>For f4:</p>

<pre><code>fit &lt;- multinom(f4 ~ ds, data = xx)
summary(fit)
z &lt;- summary(fit)$coefficients/summary(fit)$standard.errors
p &lt;- (1 - pnorm(abs(z), 0, 1))*2
</code></pre>

<p>My questions:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Is running such logistic regression analyses appropriate for what I want to do, namely to tease out contributions of each factor? If so, is it meaningful to compare the coefficients of each factor with the other, when computed separately? Or is simply showing a correlation matrix sufficient in my case?</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Are there alternative techniques to assess all outcome variables/DVs at once, with respect to each level of my IV? If so, could you please provide me with some pointers (ideally for R)? I'm now looking into hierarchical multinomial marginal (HMM) models... </p>

<p>If something is unclear above, Iâ€™d be happy to clarify.</p>

<p>I'm estimating the probability of an diagnosis given some confounders and a measure of monthly temperature. I have two possible temperature definitions I'm considering: monthly average temperature and monthly average <em>high</em> temperature. I don't expect the response to temperature to be linear, so I broke average temperature into 5 degree bins with bottom and top coding at &lt; 40 and > 90. I did the same with average high temperature but shifted the bins slightly with bottom and top coding &lt; 50 and > 100. </p>

<p>I estimate the first logistic model </p>

<pre><code>event ~ age + sex + ... + mean_temp_group
</code></pre>

<p>and get the response I'd expect from my theorized process. However, I'd prefer to report the results using mean high temperature since average temperature is misleadingly low (average temp of 70, for instance, is pretty warm with highs in the 80s but people think ""70 degrees? That's wonderful!""). So I estimate the same model but instead replace <code>mean_temp_group</code> with <code>mean_high_group</code>:</p>

<pre><code>event ~ age + sex + ... + mean_high_group
</code></pre>

<p>and the results don't match either my theory or what I saw with <code>mean_temp_group</code>. </p>

<p>That seems weird given how similar the two variables are. The average and average high variables have a correlation coefficient of 0.9939. In essence the average high is the average plus a constant (on average, 9.4 degrees with a standard deviation of 2.1). </p>

<p>At first I assumed this was a problem with the code, so I re-pulled the data (still have the same problem and the data extraction seems to be accurate). I also took the model with <code>mean_temp_group</code> and edited the formula in place to read <code>mean_high_group</code> lest I omitted/included a different variable between the models (I didn't). </p>

<p>I assume it has something to do with the binning or something along those lines - any ideas? I'm very confused by two variables that basically appear to be an additive shift of each other giving very different results. </p>

<ol>
<li>UV1 is not significant! :-)</li>
<li>UV2 has an positive effect on AV = 1! :-)</li>
<li>The intercept is 0.5! :-)</li>
</ol>

<p>My overall question: Why isn't logistic regression (including ""family = ""binomial"") producing results as expected, but a ""NOT-logistic"" regression (not including ""family = ""binomial"") does?</p>

<p>Update:
are the observations described above because of the correlation of UV1 and UV 2. Corr = 0.56
After manipulating the UV2's data </p>

<p>AV: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0</p>

<p>UV1: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0</p>

<p>UV2: <strong>0, 0, 0,</strong> 1, 1, 1, 1, <strong>1, 1, 1</strong>, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0</p>

<p>(I changed the positions of the three 0s with the three 1s in UV2 to gain a correlation &lt; 0.1 between UV1 and UV2) hence:</p>

<pre><code>UV1 UV2 AV
1    1   0  1
2    1   0  1
3    1   0  1
4    1   1  1
5    1   1  1
6    1   1  1
7    1   1  1
8    0   1  1
9    0   1  1
10   0   1  1
11   1   1  0

18   0   0  0
19   0   0  0

<p>to avoid correlation, my results come closer to my expectations:</p>

<p>But why does the correlation influence the results of the logistic regression and not the results of the ""not-logistic"" regression? </p>
