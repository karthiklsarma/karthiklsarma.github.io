"NaN","NaN","214810","<p>The DCC model is defined through the proxy $Q_t$ as
$$Q_t=(1-\alpha-\beta) \overline{Q} +\alpha\epsilon_{t-1}\epsilon_{t-1}' + \beta Q_{t-1}$$which is then normalized to find the correlation matrix $R_t$
$$R_t=\frac{q_{ij,t}}{\sqrt{q_{ii,t}q_{jj,t}}}$$</p>

<p>I've been using the <code>rmgarch</code> package and its copula-garch commands (<code>cgarchspec</code> and <code>cgarchfit</code>) to couple time series with either a normal or Student-t copula and a DCC dependence structure.</p>

<p>All results are nice and everything, but my question is on a problem which is present also at the univariate GARCH level: how is $Q_0$ chosen for the first estimation of $Q_1$? I've been going through the <code>rmgarch</code> document and other references on the Internet but haven't found any relevant info. </p>

"NaN","NaN","221518","<p>I'm trying to investigate how events affect the stock market through econo-physics and I came across a paper that uses the co-variance matrix. </p>

<p>What I don't understand is how such a matrix can be formed with one time series. The paper says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We study here the behaviour of the first three eigenvalues (Î»1, Î»2,
  Î»3) and their ratio [(Î»1/Î»2), (Î»1/Î»3), (Î»2/Î»3)] of the co-variance matrices
  of the original return series and of those rebuilt from wavelet
  components for emerging and mature markets.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How can I replicate this if I'm looking at a series like the DJIA?</p>

<p><code>cov(ts)</code> simply returns a single value.</p>
