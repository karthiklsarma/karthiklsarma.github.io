<p>I've read that KS gives more emphasis to the middle part of the distributions and AD to the tails. On the loglike one maximizes the probability of a model fitting the data.
The graphical analysis says to me that Log-normal, Gamma and Weibull only fit the data well at the left tail whereas the other distributions fit data quite well all over the domain....
So why does these three dist. have a larger loglike than the others that seem to fit better the data? Thanks</p>

"0.5","0.447213595499958"," 49497","<p>I have a dataset I'm working on that has some co-variate shift between the training set and the test set.  I'm trying to build a predictive model to predict an outcome, using the training set.  So far my best model is a random forest.</p>

<p>How can I deal with the shifted distributions in the training vs. test set?  I've come across 2 possible solutions that I've been able to implement myself:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the shifted variables.  This is sub-optimal, but helps prevent my model from over fitting the training set.</li>
<li>Use a logistic regression to predict whether a given observation is from the test set (after balancing the classes), predict ""test set probabilities"" for the training set, and then boostrap sample the training set, using the probabilities for sampling.  Then fit the final model on the new training set.</li>
</ol>

<p>Both 1 and 2 are pretty easy to implement, but neither one satisfies me, as #1 omits variables that might be relevant, and #2 uses a logistic regression, when my final model is tree-based.  Furthermore, #2 takes a few paragraphs of custom code, and I worry that my implementation may not be correct.</p>

<p>What are the standard methods for dealing with covariate shift?  Are there any packages in R (or another language) that implement these methods?</p>

<p>/edit: It seems like ""kernel mean matching"" is another approach I could take.  I've found lots of academic papers on the subject, but no one seems to have published any code.  I'm going to try to implement this on my own, and will post the code as an answer to this question when I do.</p>

"0.709208143266975","0.683130051063973"," 71414","<p>I'm trying to use a zero-inflated gamma model (or a gamma 'hurdle' model). The model is a mixture of logistic regression and generalized linear modeling. I can do this analysis in two steps: 1) do a logistic regression against presence/absence data and then 2) Use a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution on the positive values. I'm trying to set the model up where, if y = 0, then E(y) = p, but if y > 0, then E(y) is gamma distributed.</p>

<p>I'm trying to set this up in BUGS/JAGS, because I've seen these models <a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/15967/how-can-i-set-up-a-zero-inflated-poisson-in-jags"">worked before for poisson-distributions</a>. I tried to adapt the code from that link into a gamma distribution, but I can't quite seem to get it to work. I know the code won't work because my data have zeroes, and the likelihood function can't be evaluated with zeroes. However, even when restricted to positive values, I get errors for invalid parent values. Even so, I'm not even sure the model is specified correctly.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong></p>

<p>I've gotten it to run by deleting the definition of logGamma[i] and putting it directly into the likelihood function, which now reads:</p>

<pre><code>logLik[i] &lt;- (1 - z[i]) * log(1 - w[i]) + z[i] * ( log(w[i]) + (shape[i] - 1)*log(y[i]) - y[i]/scale[i] - shape[i]*log(scale[i]) - loggam(scale[i]) )
</code></pre>

<p>The problem was that JAGS was trying to evaluate the log likelihood at all observations first, resulting in NA's for the 0's. In the new way, it only evaluates it if z = 1 (I think). I'm still having trouble getting the parameter estimates to line up. For example, the gamma's are almost identical to a logistic regression of the same form (hooray!). But the betas are pretty far off from a gamma GLM of the positive values. I don't know if this is normal or not, but I suspect there are still problems with my model specification.</p>

<p>My problem is that the probabilities computed with the parameters returned by <code>multinom</code>, following the usual <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression#As_a_set_of_independent_binary_regressions"" rel=""nofollow"">definition</a> of multinomial logistic model, are not the same as those directly computed in <code>R</code>, which are the correct ones.

<p>Do you know an <code>R</code> package which fits conditional probabilities and returns the corresponding parameters of the model, so that we may easily compute the probabilities in another program? E.g., using the MARS model (<code>R</code> package <code>earth</code>) or Projection Pursuit Regression (<code>R</code> package <code>ppr</code>) is not feasible, since computing the probabilities from the parameters of these models would be a mess. Besides, the function <code>mlogit</code> from the <code>R</code> package with the same name is not applicable as well, since the dataset should be in a certain format (we would also need the predictors corresponding to the alternative, ""non-chosen"" response variable).</p>

<p>However, I've run into a bit of a logical problem. I can successfully generate gamma, weibull, logistic, normal and poisson distributions and correctly identify them, but as soon as I try to identify an exponential distribution, the resulting p-values are always lower than the p-values from trying to fit a weibull or gamma distribution. So, to put it another way, I generate a random set of values from an exponential distribtion using</p>

<pre><code>rexp(1000)

<p>In addition I have a model selection method $\phi$ which would pick a model's estimate among the model set as its own according to its assessment on previous performance of the models ($\hat{y}^\phi_n = \min_i\{\hat{f_i}(y_n), i \in I\} $).</p>

<p>My claim should be ""model selection's performance is better than all models it picks estimates from"". I am trying to find a proper method to describe the statistical power of the model selection method, compared to individual models in the model set.</p>

<p>All individual models follow different assumptions, distributions and dependence structure. Some are iid, some have heteroskedasticity. Actually, there is no restriction on models except it should yield an estimate.</p>

<p>Some The models are employed on time series but what they do is asset pricing on different assets and contracts. But for a broaded audience I will make the following analogy.</p>

<p>Suppose you have many machines of this sort and all have different predictions. All of them had been right on some occasion (That is what statistics is after all right? No model is perfect.). </p>

<p>I am trying to figure out which machine is better at predicting what and when, using the previous performance of the machines. I can say stuff like 'oh machine A was good at predicting scores occured in the last 10 mins, but for the last 2 months model B became better'. </p>

<p>It turns out my estimates using the machines are better than any machine could do it alone in the long run. I checked for several error terms starting with MAPE and MSE. But I want to show that it is not a coincidence but a statistically significant fact. I have a fair sample size (~100k) over a good enough time period (5 years).</p>

<p>I fiddled with some thoughts about proportion of $\phi$ selecting the model with the lowest error and some logistic regression on that according to the criteria it uses to pick the models. But I lack the comprehensive knowledge on this domain of statistics.</p>

"0.5","0.447213595499958","229624","<p>I have been working to fit a normal distribution to data that is truncated to only be zero or greater. Given my data, which I have at the bottom, I previously used the following code: </p>

<pre><code>library(fitdistrplus)
library(truncnorm)
fitdist(testData, ""truncnorm"", start = list(a = 0, mean = 0.8, sd = 0.9))
</code></pre>

<p>Which, of course, won't work for a number of reasons, not least of which being that the mle estimator provides increasingly negative estimates as <code>a</code> tends towards zero. I previously got some very helpful information about fitting a normal distribution to this data <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38838343/fitting-truncnorm-using-fitdistrplus/38839835#38839835"">here</a>, where two basic options were presented:</p>

<p>I might either use a low, negative value for <code>a</code>, and try out a number of different values</p>

<pre><code>fitdist(testData, ""truncnorm"", fix.arg=list(a=-.15),
        start = list(mean = mean(testData), sd = sd(testData)))

<pre><code>fitdist(testData, ""truncnorm"", fix.arg=list(a=0),
        start = list(mean = mean(testData), sd = sd(testData)),
        optim.method=""L-BFGS-B"", lower=c(0, 0))
</code></pre>

<p>Either way, though, it seems that some information is being lost - in the first case, because <code>a</code> isn't being truncated at zero, and in the second because the parameters have arbitrary lower bounds - I'm only concerned with achieving a good fit of the data, not with having positive a positive mean for the distribution. Given that mle estimators tend negative as <code>a</code> goes to zero, would it be better to use non-mle estimation? Does it make sense to have negative values of a if the data itself can't be negative?</p>

<p>This question applies more generally as well, as I have been using the <code>truncdist</code> package to try to fit Weibull, Log Normal, and Logistic distributions as well (for the Weibull, of course, there is no need to truncate at zero).</p>
