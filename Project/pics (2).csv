I will say that I personally haven't done all that much Java development; so for all I know there could be much more idiomatic ways to illustrate this point. Perhaps if we write out a method to do the equivalent of what does it will make this clearer. Right? Increment the value passed and return the original value: that's the definition of the postincrement operator. Now, let's see how this behavior plays out in your example code:does what? Increments, yes. And then. This return value then gets assigned to. So the order of values assigned to is 0, then 1, then 0. This might be clearer still if we re-write the above: Your fixation on the fact that when you replace on the left side of the above assignment with, ""you can see that it first increments x, and later attributes it to y"" strikes me as confused. It is not that is being assigned to; it is. Really, injecting makes things no different from the scenario above; we've simply got: So it's clear: effectively does not change the value of x. It always causes x to have the values x , then x+ 1, and then xagain. : Incidentally, lest you doubt that ever gets assigned to 1 ""between"" the increment operation and the assignment in the example above, I've thrown together a quick demo to illustrate that this intermediate value does indeed ""exist,"" though it will never be ""seen"" on the executing thread.

With index-based iteration, you are free to modify the list in any way.

Changes to the internal state of will always be seen in the internal state of the corresponding element on the list. Essentially, there only two ways to iterate over a list: by using an index or by using an iterator. The enhanced for loop is just a syntactic shortcut introduced in Java 5 to avoid the tedium of explicitly defining an iterator. For both styles, you can come up with essentially trivial variations using, or blocks, but they all boil down to the same thing (or, rather, two things).

Eventually he runs out of eggs. A job well done. The second one sets up a bowl, opens the crate, and then dashes off to get a piece of paper and a pen. He writes the numbers 0 through 11 next to the compartments of the egg carton, and the number 0 on the paper. He looks at the number on the paper, finds the compartment labelled 0, removes the egg and cracks it into the bowl. He looks at the 0 on the paper again, thinks ""0 + 1 = 1"", crosses out the 0 and writes 1 on the paper. He grabs the egg from compartment 1 and cracks it. And so on, until the number 12 is on the paper and he knows (without looking!) that there are no more eggs. A job well done. You'd think the second guy was a bit messed in the head, right? The point of working in a high-level language is to avoid having to describe things in a computer's terms, and to be able to describe them in your own terms. The higher-level the language, the more true this is. Incrementing a counter in a loop is a distraction from what you really want to do: process each element. Further to that, linked-list type structures can't be processed efficiently by incrementing a counter and indexing in: ""indexing"" means starting over counting from the beginning. In C, we can process a linked list that we made ourselves by using a pointer for the loop ""counter"" and dereferencing it. We can do this in modern C++ (and to an extent in C# and Java) using ""iterators"", but this still suffers from the indirectness problem. Finally, some languages are high-enough level that the idea of actually to ""perform an operation on each item in a list"" or ""search for an item in a list"" is appalling (in the same way that the head chef shouldn't have to tell the first kitchen staff member how to ensure that all the eggs are cracked).

By do you mean modify it in place in the list, or simply do something with the item (e.g. print it, accumulate it, modify it, etc.)? I suspect it is the latter, since in C# won't allow you to modify the collection you are looping over, or at least not in a convenient way... Here are two simple constructs, first using and then using, which visit all strings in a list and turn them into uppercase strings: (note that using the end condition instead of with some precomputer constant is considered a good practice in .NET, since the compiler would anyway have to check for the upper bound when is invoked in the loop; if my understanding is correct, the compiler is able in some circumstances to optimize away the upper bound check it would normally have done). Here is the equivalent: Note: basically, the construct can iterate over any or in C#, not just over arrays or lists. The number of elements in the collection might therefore not be known beforehand, or might even be infinite (in which case you certainly would have to include some termination condition in your loop, or it won't exit). Here are a few equivalent solutions I can think of, expressed using C# LINQ (and which introduces the concept of a, basically an inline function taking an and returning in the following examples): Or with the list populated by its constructor: Or the same using the function: Or still the same with type inference: or if you don't mind getting the result as an (an enumerable collection of strings), you could drop the: Or maybe another one with the C# SQL-like and keywords, which is fully equivalent: LINQ is very expressive and very often, I feel that the code is more readable than a plain loop. Your second question, can also be very conveniently be implemented using LINQ. Here is an example of a loop: Here is the straightforward LINQ equivalent: or with the query syntax: The enumeration is only executed, which means that effectively, the list will only be iterated until the condition is met, when invoking the method on it.

Hot spots are pieces of your code that are executed many many times. To do this, the JVM will ""count"" the executions of various instructions, and when it determines a certain piece is executed frequently, it will trigger the JIT. (this is an approximation, but it's easy to understand explained this way). The JIT (Just-In-Time) takes that piece of code, and tries to make it faster. The techniques used by the JIT to make your code run faster are a lot, but the one that most commonly creates confusion are : So, the proper answer to your question is that an empty loop, after being JITed, takes no time to execute .. most probably is not there anymore. Again, there are many other optimizations, but in my experience these are among those that have created most headaches. Moreover, JIT is being improved in any new version of Java, and sometimes it is even a bit different depending on the platform (since it is to some extent platform specific). Optimizations done by the JIT are difficult to understand, because you cannot usually find them using javap and inspecting bytecode, even if in recent versions of Java some of these optimizations have been moved to the compiler directly (for example, since Java 6 the compiler is able to detect and warn about unused local variables and private methods). If you are writing some loops to test something, it is usually good practice to have the loop inside a method, call the method a few times BEFORE timing it, to give it a ""speed up"" round, and then perform the timed loop.This usually triggers the JIT in a simple program like yours, even if there is no guarantee that it will actually trigger (or that it even exists on a certain platform). If you want to get paranoid about JIT or non JIT timing (I did): make a first round, timing each execution of the loop, and wait until the timing stabilize (for example, difference from the average less than 10%), then start with your ""real"" timing."

Let's think about writing a method to print a single line, telling the method which number line it is: We have to print some number of spaces, then some number of stars. Looking at the example, I can see that (if the first row is 0) it's (5-rowNumber) spaces and (2*rowNumber + 1) stars. Let's invent a method that prints the rows of characters for us, and use it: That won't compile until we actually write printSequence(), so let's do that: Now you can printSequence on its own, and you can printTriangleLine on its own. For now you can just try it out by calling those methods directly in... run it and verify (with your eyes) that it outputs: When you get further into programming, you'll want to use a like jUnit. Instead of printing, you'd more likely write things like printTriangleLine to return a String (which you'd print from higher up in your program), and you would automate your testing with commands like: Now we have the pieces we need to draw a triangle. The code we have written is a bit longer than the answers other people have given. But we have been able to test each step, and we have methods that we can use again in other problems. In real life, we have to find the right balance between breaking a problem into too many methods, or too few. I tend to prefer lots of really short methods. For extra credit:"

Expanding on Michael Burr's answer, if the outer loops are doing nothing but controlling a count, then your nested loops over counts are simply a more complicated way of iterating over the product of the counts with a single loop. Now, let's extend this idea to Lists. If you're iterating over three lists in nested loops, this is simply a more complicated way of iterating over the product of the lists with a single loop. But how do you express the product of three lists? First, we need a way of expressing the product of types. The product of two types and can be expressed as a generic type like. This is just a value that consists of two values, one of type, the other of type. It looks like this: For a product of three types, we just have, with the obvious third method. A product of three lists, then, is achieved by distributing the List functor over the product type. So the product of,, and is simply. You can then iterate over this list with a single loop. The library has a type that supports multiplying lists together using first-class functions and product types (P2, P3, etc. which are also included in the library).

When a variable does not exist outside the block, the register used to store the variable can be used for other purposes. This, of course, depends on the compiler implementation. I don't know about Java, but at least some C compiler manufacturers have given this recommendation in their documentation. As for readability, my opinion is that in short functions it is better to declare all variables at the beginning where they can be easily found. In very long functions (which should be avoided anyway), it may be better to declare the variable inside a block (which just happens to be more efficient, too)."

Out of experience I'd not declare a variable within a loop; an int will certainly be optimized out by the compiler and re-use the same memory address, and the extra computational cost might be negligible. But. If you were declaring an object inside a loop, then things will be different. What if your object, when created, does an I/O write? A network DNS lookup? You might not know/care. So, best practice is declare it ouside. Also, do not mix up performance with best practice. They might lead you into dangerous territory. "

It has a number of intermediate representations that make bytecode analysis more convenient (e.g. Jimple). You can build a based on your method body, for example an. Once you've decomposed the control flow graph into such a block graph, from the nodes, you should be able to identity the dominators (i.e. blocks that have an arrow coming back to them). This will give you the start of the loop. You may find something similar done in. Following the discussion with @Peter in comments to his answer. Talking the same example: This time, compiled with the Eclipse compiler (no specific option: simply autocompilation from within the IDE). This code hasn't been obfuscated (apart from being bad code, but that's a different matter).Here is the result (from): There is a loop between 3 and 12 (jumped in starting a 10) and another loop, due to the exception occurring from the division by zero at 8 to 22.Unlike the compiler result, where one could make as guess that there was an outer loop between 0 and 22 and an inner loop between 0 and 12, the nesting is less obvious here. To illustrate the kind of problems you may get with a less awkward example. Here is a relatively simple loop: After (normal) compilation within Eclipse, gives this: Before doing anything within the loop, you jump straight from 2 to 15. Block 15 to 17 is the header of the loop (the ""entry point""). Sometimes, the header block could contain far more instructions, especially if the exit condition involves more evaluation, or if it's a loop.The concept of ""entry"" and ""exit"" of a loop may not always reflect what you'd write sensibly as Java source code (including the fact that you can rewrite loops as loops, for example). Using can also lead to multiple exit points. By the way, by ""block"", I mean a sequence of bytecode into which you can't jump and out of which you can't jump in the middle: they're only entered from the first line (not necessarily from the previous line, possibly from a jump from somewhere else) and exited from the last (not necessarily to the following line, it can jump somewhere else too). It seems that new classes/methods to analyse loops have been added since last time I had looked at Soot, which make it a bit more convenient. Here is a complete example. The class/method to analyse ( ) When compiled by the Eclipse compiler, this produces this bytecode ( ): Here is a program that loads the class (assuming it's on the classpath here) using Soot and displays its blocks and loops: Check the Soot documentation for more details on how to load classes. The is a model for the body of the loop, i.e. all the statements made from the bytecode. This uses the intermediate Jimple representation, which is equivalent to the bytecode, but easier to analyse and process. Here is the output of this program: Body: Blocks: Loops:uses, which uses an to build the list of blocks.The class will give you the entry statement and the exit statements. You should then be able to add extra statements if you wish. Jimple is quite convenient for this (it's close enough to the bytecode, but has a slightly higher level so as not to deal with everything manually). You can then output your modified file if needed. (See the Soot documentation for this.)"

If you actually need the split words try the following:

Long answer: First, the iterative version of your recursive method: This works by replacing the recursive call with assignment to the parameters, and sticking it all in a loop. But like your original code, this contains a bug! (I can't think of actual words that this bug works with, so imagine my made up words are real words.) Suppose your long word is ABCDEFGH, and that ABCD, EFGH, and ABCDE are all words, but FGH isn't. looks for the longest word first, so it will match ABCDE, then discover that FGH isn't a word, and tell you that ABCDEFGH can't be cut into subwords. But it could be split into ABCD and EFGH! It misses the shorter initial match because you don't consider other options once you've found a match. (And if your code started by looking for the shorter match, it still wouldn't work if ABC was a word and DEFGH wasn't.) So: Now, turning this into an iterative method is harder: sometimes you have recursive calls. That means simply assigning to your parameters won't work, because you need the parameters' original values to calculate the parameters for the second call. You have to explicitly manage a stack or a queue with all the different values, because now the language isn't doing it for you."

The simple answer is No. You seem to be suggesting a compiler switch that tells / allows the compiler to ignore the JLS rules.There is no such switch.Such a switch would be a.It would be liable to cause correct/valid/working programs to break.Consider this: If the compiler was permitted to move the call out of the loop, it would change the number of times that the method was called, and therefore change the value returned by the method.

Currently this has done what I've wanted, now that I've started adding movement for a player and obviously I don't want to move him across the screen as fast as I possibly can. So I have an input map and action map in my Island class and that detects the key presses and releases and tells my player class which keys are being held. I then move my player about inside the player class with a swing timer that calls every 10ms. So I guess this is like my game tick, my game will make frames as fast as it possibly can and then the game does all its logic stuff 100 times a second, I will be adding more to the gamelogic of course, not just movement. After doing some research it would appear a swing timer isn't the best way of doing this as it is designed for doing small tasks and for swing tasks. So I guess my question is, is it sensible to make my frames the way I am in my main method, and what would be a good way of getting my game to tick reliably every 10ms or whatever? I've had a few ideas, like maybe I should make a new thread that handles the game logic and use the System.getnanotime or whatever its called to measure the time taken to do a tick and then do a wee thread.sleep for however long it is until we reach 10ms and then repeat.

The normal loop is needed when access to the index is required. Although you could manually create a separate index int-variable with it is not ideal, from a point of view. Here's some more information:When accessing collections, a is than the basic loop's array access. When accessing arrays, however--at least with primitive and wrapper-arrays--access via indexes is faster. See below. Indexes are 23-percent faster than iterators when accessing or arrays. Here is the output from the below testing class, which sums the numbers in a 100-element primitive-int array (A is iterator, B is index): The full testing class: I also ran this for an array, and indexes are still the clear winner, but only between 18 and 25 percent faster.

I also think the intent of this problem wasn't the tasks of joining strings together, but the pattern in general, so it doesn't really help to show library functions that can do that. Firstly though the actions of surrounding a string with [] and creating a string separated by commas are two separate actions, and ideally would be two separate functions. For any language, I think the combination of recursion and pattern matching works best. For example, in haskell I would do this: The benefit of writing it like this is it clearly enumerates the different situations that the function will face, and how it will handle it.Another very nice way to do this is with an accumulator type function. Eg: This can be done in other languages as well, eg c#: Not very efficient in this situation, but can be useful in other cases (or efficiency may not matter). Unfortunately, java can't use either of those methods. So in this case I think the best way is to have checks at the top of the function for the exception cases (0 or 1 elements), and then use a for loop to handle the case with more than 1 element: This function clearly shows what happens in the two edge cases (0 or 1 elements). It then uses a loop for all but the last elements, and finally adds the last element on without a comma. The inverse way of handling the non-comma element at the start is also easy to do. Note that the line isn't actually necessary, however I think it makes what the function does more easier to determine at a glance. (Note that if anyone wants more explanation on the haskell/c# functions ask and I'll add it in) "

For example, the following will cycle once through a loop approximately every 50 milliseconds: This should bring down the CPU utilization quite a bit. With a sleep in the loop, the operating system will also give enough system time for other threads and processes to do their things, so the system will be responsive as well. Back in the days of single core systems and operating systems with not-so-good schedulers, loops like this could have made the system very unresponsive. Since the topic of use of loops for a game came up, if the game is going to involve a GUI, the game loop must be in a separate thread or else the GUI itself will become unresponsive. If the program is going to be a console-based game, then threading is not going to be an issue, but with graphical user interfaces which are event-driven, having a long-living loop in the code will make the GUI unresponsive.

And that's why wait/notify must be called from within sync'd blocks or methods (not clear if you are doing that here).

But there is also another factor to consider: Actually is needed in non-blocking threads to allow other threads to continue. Because if there is no wait at all, the OS can't allocate resources to any other thread and they will starvate. On the other side, in reality cause a much longer wait depending how the OS allocates the resources. But that's up to the OS. When programming, there are always 2 factors to consider: Therefore it's all about the (or in general: Bytes/s). You can't only make the right decisions based on the allocated resources as many programmers intend to do. It's even possible be that above non-blocking floop uses a lot less resources than a blocking one, because there is no synchronisation overhead.

Complex data types can be combinations of primitive and other complex data types and are called ""Class"" in Java. You can define the complex data type PeopleName consisting of two Strings called first and last name. Each String in Java is another complex data type. Strings in return are (probably) implemented using the primitive data type char for which Java knows how many bits they take to store and how to interpret them. When you create an instance of a data type, you get an object and your computers reserves some memory for it and remembers its location and the name of that instance. An instance of PeopleName in memory will take up the space of the two String variables plus a bit more for bookkeeping. An integer takes up 32 bits in Java. Complex data types can have methods assigned to them. Methods can perform actions on their arguments or on the instance of the data type you call this method from.

So here goes. A hash table (note that I'm not using an actual classname) is basically an array of linked lists. To find something in the table, you first compute the hashcode of that something, then mod it by the size of the table. This is an index into the array, and you get a linked list at that index. You then traverse the list until you find your object. Since array retrieval is O(1), and linked list traversal is O(n), you want a hash function that creates as random a distribution as possible, so that objects will be hashed to different lists. Every object could return the value 0 as its hashcode, and a hash table would still work, but it would essentially be a long linked-list at element 0 of the array. You also generally want the array to be large, which increases the chances that the object will be in a list of length 1. The Java HashMap, for example, increases the size of the array when the number of entries in the map is > 75% of the size of the array. There's a tradeoff here: you can have a huge array with very few entries and waste memory, or a smaller array where each element in the array is a list with > 1 entries, and waste time traversing. A perfect hash would assign each object to a unique location in the array, with no wasted space. The term ""perfect hash"" is a real term, and in some cases you can create a hash function that provides a unique number for each object. This is only possible when you know the set of all possible values. In the general case, you can't achieve this, and there will be some values that return the same hashcode. This is simple mathematics: if you have a string that's more than 4 bytes long, you can't create a unique 4-byte hashcode. One interesting tidbit: hash arrays are generally sized based on prime numbers, to give the best chance for random allocation when you mod the results, regardless of how random the hashcodes really are. Edit based on comments: 1) A linked list is not the only way to represent the objects that have the same hashcode, although that is the method used by the JDK 1.5 HashMap. Although less memory-efficient than a simple array, it does arguably create less churn when rehashing (because the entries can be unlinked from one bucket and relinked to another). 2) As of JDK 1.4, the HashMap class uses an array sized as a power of 2; prior to that it used 2^N+1, which I believe is prime for N <= 32. This does not speed up array indexing per se, but does allow the array index to be computed with a bitwise AND rather than a division, as noted by Neil Coffey. Personally, I'd question this as premature optimization, but given the list of authors on HashMap, I'll assume there is some real benefit."

If you are only interested in object equality, then the implementation of .equals() (the one provided by Object) uses identity only (i.e. this == other).If that's what you want, then just don't implement equals() on your class (let it inherit from Object).The code you wrote, while kind of correct if you are going for identity, would never appear in a real class b/c it provides no benefit over using the default Object.equals() implementation.

Equal objects should have the same 'value' and semantics when used by client code. Purer object-oriented languages do not have an identity comparison, as client code generally shouldn't care whether or not two objects have the same memory address. If objects represent the same real-world entity, then that is better modelled using some ID or key value rather than identity, which then becomes part of the equals contract.

So I decided to to add more explanations. Why do you have to override equals()? Well, because this is in the domain of a developer to decide what does it mean for two objects to be equal. Reference equality is not enough for most of the cases.For example, imagine that you have a HashMap whose keys are of type Person. Each person has name and address. Now, you want to find detailed bean using the key. The problem is, that you usually are not able to create an instance with the same reference as the one in the map. What you do is to create another instance of class Person. Clearly, operator == will not work here and you have to use equals(). But now, we come to another problem. Let's imagine that your collection is very large and you want to execute a search. The naive implementation would compare your key object with every instance in a map using equals(). That, however, would be very expansive. And here comes the hashCode(). As others pointed out, hashcode is a single number that does not have to be unique. The important requirement is that whenever equals() gives true for two objects, hashCode() must return the same value for both of them. The inverse implication does not hold, which is a good thing, because hashcode separates our keys into kind of buckets. We have a small number of instances of class Person in a single bucket. When we execute a search, the algorithm can jump right away to a correct bucket and only now execute equals for each instance. The implementation for hashCode() therefore must distribute objects as evenly as possible across buckets. There is one more point. Some collections require a proper implementation of a hashCode() method in classes that are used as keys not only for performance reasons. The examples are: HashSet and LinkedHashSet. If they don��Η��t override hashCode(), the default ObjecthashCode() method will allow multiple objects that you might consider ""meaningfullyequal"" to be added to your ""no duplicates allowed"" set. Some of the collections that use hashCode() Have a look at those two classes from apache commons that will allow you to implement equals() and hashCode() easily"

Going back to the first version of HotSpot (and a bit earlier for the ""classic VM""), references were implemented as handles. That is a fixed pointer to a pointer. The first pointer never changes for any particular object, but as the object data itself is moved the second pointer is changed. Obviously this impacts performance in use, but is easier to write a GC for. In the latest builds of JDK7 there is support for ""compressed oops"". I believe BEA JRockit has had this for some time. Moving to 64 bit systems requires twice as much memory and hence bandwidth for addresses. ""Compressed oops"" takes advantage of the least significant three or four bits of address always being zero. 32 bits of data are shifted left three or four bits, allowing 32 or 64 GB of heap instead of 4 GB."

The most appropriate description isthat these objects are of class, which has as its superclass. Now, to your question on. It is the superclass of everything that can be instantiated by the java runtime. That includes both: It doesn't. It only support single (or) inheritance (in conjunction with multiple (or) inheritance.You are confusing inheritance with class hierarchy. Pls see further below. And that's fine with multiple inheritance. Say you have a class B that you wrote inheriting from a class alreadyprovided by Java (say class A). So there is a linear, transitive relation as follows: Where stands for. Any class inheriting from Object can only have. At no point you'll have a class C for which the following constrain for any two classes A and B does not hold: Meaning, for all classes A and B such that A is an of B, then for all classes C, C can only be an of B *C is itself A. With single inheritance you can have (theoretically) an infinite inheritance chain so long as every class in the chain is preceeded by immediate parent. As a useful analogy, this resemble the relationship in natural numbers ( ). : This is not stuff that you use in day-to-day programming life activities. However, knowing precisely what these things mean under the hood will tremendously help you get through object orientation. No (see above.) As opposed to single inheritance - explained above - in multiple inheritance you can have multiple immediate parents (as seen in C++).As we noticed in the definitions above, the transitive inheritance relation '>' is from one class to another. But with multiple inheritance, the relation is from a set of superclasses to a single class: And in C++ where you can have classes without parents, then the set can be the null set.In java, you also have multiple inheritance, but limited to (or types.) No. It will help your learning if you take a visit to the Javadoc manuals which are available online. Look it up. Really. Because instances of java.lang.Class (and all classes used by java reflections) are meta-data descriptors for other classes. This has nothing to do with inheritance. What you are referring to here is known as. Furthermore, java.lang.Class is a final class; ergo, it cannot be the superclass of anything.The function of java.lang.Class is to be a meta-data provider/descriptor for all instances and subclasses of java.lang.Object (including java.lang.Class itself.) The class field associated to each class (.ie. String.class) is a static, class-level field describing the meta-data associated to that class.The meta-data contained/described by java.lang.Class contains meta-data accessor objects for methods, constructors and fields. Again, this has nothing to do with inheritance. Inheritance =/= meta-programming. Hope it helps."

You can think of this as a performance hack.) So, first the JVM allocates space for the String. You typically don't know or care about the internals of the String implementation, so just take it on trust that a chunk of memory is being used to represent ""some property value"". Also, you have some memory temporarily allocated containing a reference to the String. In the second form, it's explicitly called; in your original form Java handles it without naming it. Next the JVM allocates space for a new SomeObject. That's a bit of space for Java's internal bookkeeping, and space for each of the object's fields. In this case, there's just one field,. Bear in mind that is just a reference to a String. For now, it'll be initialised to null. Next, the constructor is executed.All this does is copy the to the String, into your field.

When programmers look at practicalities and how to actually something, there are a number of times when you need some totally arbitrary Object whose actual instance is totally irrelevant.It just cannot be null.The example I gave in a comment to another post is the implementation of (== or or type of choice), which is commonly done by using a backing and using the keys as the Set.You often cannot use as the value, so what is commonly done is to use a static instance as the value, which will be ignored and never used.However, some non-null placeholder is needed. Another common use is with the keyword where is needed to synchronize on, and you want to ensure that your synchronizing item is totally private to avoid deadlock where different classes are unintentionally synchronizing on the same lock. A very common idiom is to allocate a to use in a class as the lock.To be fair, as of Java 5 and and related additions, this idiom is measurably less applicable. Historically, it has been quite useful in Java to have be instantiable.You could make a good point that with small changes in design or with small API changes, this would no longer be necessary.You're probably correct in this. And yes, the API could have provided a class that extends without adding anything at all, to be used as a placeholder for the purposes described above.But -- if you're extending but adding nothing, what is the value in the class other than allowing to be abstract?Mathematically, theoretically, perhaps one could find a value, but pragmatically, what value would it add to do this? There are times in programming where you need an object, object, concrete object that is not null, something that you can compare via and/or, but you just don't need any other feature to this object.It exists only to serve as a unique identifier and otherwise does absolutely nothing.satisfies this role perfectly and (IMHO) very cleanly.

A represents a date-time in UTC/GMT, that is, no time zone offset. Your values are in a time zone. In the long run, you'll be better off by not ignoring that time zone. Adjust your values. Generally think, work, and store date-times in UTC/GMT. Convert to local time as needed for presentation in the user interface. While a java.util.Date has no time zone, a Joda-Time (discussed below) does indeed know its own time zone and time zone offset. The java.util.Date and Calendar classes bundled with Java are notoriously troublesome. Avoid them. Instead, use either: Don't think of Joda-Time as any old ""extra library"". The first thing I do when creating a new project in my IDE is add the Joda-Time library. It is just that good. Or j.u.Date/Calendar is just that bad, depending on your perspective. The best way to handle a span of time is to make the beginning inclusive and the ending exclusive. Write logic where you check for GREATER THAN OR EQUALS to the beginning and LESS THAN the ending (not testing for equals on the ending). I discuss this more in along with a diagram. Joda-Time offers these classes for defining a span of time: Period, Duration, and Internal. The Hours and similar classes offer some handy utility methods. If your goal is to make a list of gaps, of spans of time where a classroom is not assigned to a class, then the obvious way it seems to me is to sort the classes chronologically (and by classroom) as in. Define an ""available"" span of time where its beginning is the prior class��Η�� ending, and its ending is the next class��Η�� beginning. I've no experience in this arena, so there may be a more clever way. See about sorting a List of Intervals. Here is some example code using Joda-Time 2.3. Specify a time zone rather than rely on default��Η�_ Create three classes as sample data, in arbitrary order��Η�_ Collect the sample data into a List��Η�_ Sort the List using a custom Comparator (see class definition below)��Η�_ Make a collection of objects representing each gap between classes we find��Η�_ The class definition for the used in code above and lifted from��Η�_ When run��Η�_ You said you only care about gaps at least 15 minutes long. A instance in Joda-Time represents the milliseconds between the start and stop points of an Interval. Here is some off-the-top-of-my-head code.Renamed ""gap"" var from above to ""gapInterval"" to remind you it is an instance. Note that is a class. The ""minutes"" var seen below is an instance, an integer primitive (""int""). Calling the method renders an primitive.The string outputs you see there are not arbitrary. Those are formats. That handy standard defines string representations of as well as the. That standard also defines a string representation of that may prove useful to you, in the format of such as ""P3Y6M4DT12H30M5S"" meaning ""three years, six months, four days, twelve hours, thirty minutes, and five seconds"". Or shorter, as in your case, a class may be for one and a quarter hours. Joda-Time uses ISO 8601 as its default for most everything, as both inputs and outputs."

However, ifyou have a memory issue, I suggest you a memory profiler.This will give you the shallow and deep space objects use and give you a picture across the whole system.This is often more useful as you can start with the biggest consumers and optimise those as even if you have been developing Java for ten years+ you will only be guessing where is the best place to optimise unless you have hard data. Another way to get the object size if you don't want to use a profiler is to allocate a large array and see how much memory is consumed, You have to do this many times to get a good idea what the average size is.

Let me start with the most basic and least useful, a void pointer: Anything can be assigned to a void pointer from the new operator as new, placement new and the like always return a void pointer.The downsides should be obvious: loss of type information about the object pointed at.For one, C++ lacks reflection or any means of interrogating the object.You'd have to keep the type information in your head and use casting back and forth to actually use it.Since there's no type-safe way to cast from a void pointer, hilarity could ensue. If this were a return type from a function: any author using your code would need to figure out what happen.Unfortunately, often times what they thing should happen and what you, the author, think should be returned from a function are very different. If you want to restrict yourself to N types which are supported instead of infinite types that java.lang.Object can handle then there are.These can hold a set of pre-defined value types on the same memory space.Unions lack two very important things: the ability to know which value was assigned and the ability to hold non-POD types.This completely rules them out for use with any object with any sort of functionality such as. To clarify what the above actually means: If I set the first char within the ""b"" portion of an instance of ""myType"" then I also am setting the first byte of the int to that same value.In C++ these are really only useful for memory hacks and extremely low level programming (think embedded and the like.)They are not idiomatic C++.Now, if you truly want a ""I can hold anything"" then use a.This can hold any object without destroying a lot of type information which is so useful.The Boost documents state better than I in their purpose.Taken from the introduction section of Any: Think of Any solving many of the problems associated with a void pointer, such as loss of information about the contained object and the ability to safely cast to proper types.solves the same type of problem of that of a union without losing object information.Moreover it can be used with non-POD type objects.As the documentation states it best: Edit: Reorganized to show the what and the why of my thoughts when I answered the OP.I've also addressed comments below."

In fact, in my real-world experience in implementing ABCs I often find that the member function that I really want to be pure virtual is the destructor.ABCs I design often have many virtual methods that are not pure and then one virtual destructor.IMO (debatable), this is a good starting point when designing an ABC:Make the dtor pure, and keep a minimal number of non-pure virtual member functions in the base class, and provide an implementation for the pure virtual dtor in the base class.As you design this way you'll find things you can't do in your actual code, and that's when you deviate from this design. *1 ) Base classes provide a definition for a pure virtual member function.But this is not the norm, and the reasons you might do this are somewhat beyond the scope of this post.Note that when you do this there is a special rule in the Standard that says you may not provide the definition along with the declaration; they must be seperate.Like this: *2) There are exceptions to the rule about having virtual destructors.Beyond the scope of this article, but a better rule of thumb is "" """

Remember that we want our module to have related task and one single responsibility. But what is coupling? Coupling is the degree of dependencyon other modules to achieve our single responsibility for that module. So by low coupling we are saying that we are not very dependant on external modules hence we have high cohesion.However, if we have many dependencies to external module we would have high coupling and low cohesion.

Now you need to distribute that reference to all the classes that use it.Here is where Dependency Injection comes in handy - by using a DI framework such as Spring you can define that the one instance of your pool will be injected into the classes that need it.

You configure the dependencies in a separate(typically XML) configuration file. It is really a separation of concerns. The class says I need this, this and this component so I functionate properly. The class doesn't care how it gets its components. You plug in them into the class with a separate configuration file. To give you an example lets consider having a shopping class which needs a payment module. You don't want to hardcode which payment module will be used. To achieve this you inverse the control. You can change the used payment module with a few keystrokes in the configuration file of the container. The power is that you aren't touching any Java code."

You will always have to create a new object by instantiating a class at some point. And dependency injection also have to create new objects. Dependency injection really comes into play when you want to control or verify the behaviour of instances used by a class that you use, or want to test. (For Test Driven Development dependency injection is key for any except the smallest example) Assume a class Holder which requires an object of class Handle. The traditional way to do that would be to let the Holder instance create and own it: The Holder instance creates myHandle and noone outside the class can get at it. In some cases, unittesting being on of them, this is a problem because it is not possible to test the Holder class without creating the Handle instance which in turn might depend on many other classes and instances. This makes testing unwieldy and cumbersome. By injecting the Handle instance, for example in the constructor, someone from the outside becomes responsible for the creation of the instance. As you can see the code is almost the same, and the Handle is still private, but the Holder class now has a much loser coupling to its outside world which makes many things simpler. And when testing the Holder class a mock or stub object can be injected instead of a real instance making it possible to verify or control the interaction between the Holder, its caller and the handle."

If you provide more information about your issue, may be we can give more tips & tricks. To control all references to an oject, you may use the Proxy Pattern. Instead of setting references to your connection object, you create a proxy object containing a private instance of the connection object. Then, have your code call the proxy who will call the connection object itself, instead of having direct references to the connection. When you are done with the connection object, close it inside the proxy object. If other parts of the code still try to access that connection objects via the proxy, you will be able to detect it in the proxy when it is called. It is a trick you can use to find which part of the code is still 'referencing' your object, so to speak. Hope this helps."

Right now, I am trying to find out how to do that in the presence of objects. I would like some clarifications on two lines I read in the JVMS (section 4.9.4): My question is, what does ""uses"" mean here? I'm guessing that it means: passing it as a method attribute, calling and on it, or calling any instance method on it. Are their other forbidden uses? And I believe that it follows that other instructions such as, and are allowed. Which means that in an method, GETFIELD and PUTFIELD are allowed before another is called. However, in Java, doing any operation on an instance field before a call to or results in a compilation error. Could someone clarify this? 3) I have one more question. When does an object reference becomes initialized, and hence, ready to be freely used? From reading the JVMS, I came up with the answer that whether an object is initialized or not, is up to each method. At a certain point in time, the object can be initialized for a method but not for the other. Specifically, an object becomes initialized for a method when called by that method returns. For example, consider that the method created an object and called which then called the superclass's. After returning from, the object is now considered initialized by , but is not yet initialized for. Does this mean, in after, I can pass the object as a parameter to a method, even before returning from to main(). Could someone confirm that this whole analysis is true? Thank you for your time.ps: I have actually posted the same question to the Sun forums but with on response. I hope I'll have more luck here. Thank you. First thank you for your answers and time. Although I didn't get a clear-cut answer (I had many questions and some of them were a bit vague), your answers and examples, and the subsequent experiments, were extremely useful for me in understanding more deeply how the JVM works. The main thing I discovered is that the Verifier's behavior differ with different implementations and versions (which makes the job of bytecode manipulation much more complicated). The problem lies in either a non-conformity to the JVMS, or a lack of documentation from the verifier's developers, or the JVMS has some subtle vagueness in the verifier's area. One last thing, SO Rocks!!! I posted the same question in the official Sun JVM Specifications forum, and I still got no answer till now."

The types of method arguments are known as they are in the method signature in the class file. The types of other local variables are not known and are inferred, so I assume the in the above statement relates to this. EDIT:Thesection 4.9.4 of the reads: This assignment of fields in the above statement is the ""initial"" initialization of the instance variables to default initial values (like int is 0, float is 0.0f etc.) when the memory for the object is allocated. There is one more ""proper"" initialization of instance variables when the virtual machine invokes the instance initialization method(constructor) on the object. The provided by John Horstmann helped clarify things. So these statements dont hold true. ""This DOESNOT mean that in an method, and are allowed before another is called.""The and instructions are used to access (and change) the instance variables(fields) of a class (or instance of a class). And this can happen only when the instance variables(fields) are initialized."" From the JVMS :And only after this can you use and. The java compiler generates atleast one instance initialization method(constructor) for every class it compiles. If the class declares no constructors explicitly, the compiler generated a default no-arg constructor that just invokes the superclass no-arg constructor. And rightly so doing any operation on an instance field before a call to or results in a compilation error. An method can contain three kinds of code: an invocation of another method, code that implements any instance variable initializers, and code for the body of the constructor. If a constructor begins with an explicit invocation of another constructor in the same class (a invocation) its corresponding method will be composed of two parts: If a constructor does not begin with a invocation and the class is not Object, the method will have three components: If a constructor does not begin with a invocation and the class is Object(and Object has no superclass), then its method cant begin with a superclass method invocation.If a constructor begins with an explicit invocation of a superclass constructor ( a invocation), its method will invoke the corresponding superclassmethod. I think this answers your first and second question. For example,Heres the bytecode for the above three constructors from the compiler(javac): In the first constructor, the method begins with calling the same-class method and then executed the body of the corresponding constructor. Because the constructor begins with a, its corresponding method doesnot contain bytecode for initializing the instance variables. In the second constructor, the method for the constructor has "

Processing files in whole: One simple trick is to have the first-stage mapper process a, not their contents. If you want 50 map jobs to run, make 50 files each with that fraction of the filenames.

This is actually the most performant and easiest way to solve this: have each machine start jobs to process all the files in e.g. (being as clever as you care to be about efficiently using local partitions and number of CPU cores). If the files originate from a SAN or from say s3 anyway, try just pulling from there directly: it's built to handle the swarm.

Are you sure your process needs everything on one host? Anything that I'd describe as a merge can be implemented pretty cleanly as a MapReduce where there is no such requirement. If you mean that you want to ensure certain keys (and their values) end up on the same reducer, you can use a to define how keys are mapped onto reducer instances. Depending on your situation, this may be what you really are after. I'll also say it kind of sounds like you are trying to operate on HDFS files, rather than write a Hadoop MapReduce. So maybe your question is really about how to hold open severals on HDFS, read their records and merge, manually. This isn't a Hadoop question then, but, still doesn't need blocks to be on one host.

Please remember all the above objects are individual and not nested classes. How do I compare 2 car objects?Any help is appreciated? Thanks"

In your case, you don't need to be using Object, as you already know that you at least have an Employee. The Object Oriented paradigm is that you don't ask an object instance it is, you ask it to do something. In this case, you have a choice of several thing you might want to ask an Employee object to do. Which one is the best choice for you depends on exactly what you're trying to model: You could ask it if it is salaried, and then possibly cast it, by adding a virtual method to the Employee base class. The base method would return false, but a SalariedEmployee would override that method and return true. But while that avoids (the likely more expensive) RTTI, it doesn't avoid the cast. You could add a method SalariedEmployee asSalariedEmployee(), which in the base class would return null and in a SalariedEmployee would return. That gives you a ""safe"" cast, but you still need a test against null. Or you could just add a Money getSalary() method to Employee.Now you don't have to do any casting, but you'd need to decide what the salary of a non-salaried employee is; that could be null, zero, or NaN (the special Not a Number value). If you decided to return null, in some cases (e.g, adding values) you'd have to test against null, in others (e.g, passing the salary to .equals()) you wouldn't need to test against null, as any instance.equals(null) should return false by the specification for Object.equals(). If you return zero, you can add without testing against null, but equals might be a bit weird -- is it really true that two hourly workers, each of whom get no salary, have the same (nonexistent) salary? That depends on what you're modeling. If it is true, return zero. If it's not true that two hourly workers have the same non-existent salary, return a NaN value. This is justa specific case of the ""Null Object Pattern""."

What about? This also won't compile, as we've said it's also of type. We know that it's actually a, but we've told the compiler ""ok, just treat this like it's a normal type"". What's often missing in a lot of these beginner examples is motivation as for someone would want to do this. Cats and Animals and the like are often poor examples. For a better example, suppose we have some code which is meant to do different things based on what operating system it's running on; say moving a file around. If it runs on, we want to move a file to say, if it's on Windows,. So we define an interface like so: Now, we don't know which system this code is going to run on until runtime - so we can do a runtime check and instantiate the proper class at runtime: Likewise, any functions can simply take a - they don't care what - hence we don't have to write two function definitions every time we want to use a different kind of, eg and, we can simply replace this with one function, pass in the correct type, and it will ""just work"".

The problem with many object pool aproaches is that they a) require a key object, which costs as much or more than creating a simple object, b) involve some synchromization/locking which again can cost as much as creating an object c) require an extra object when adding to the cache (e.g. a Map.Entry), meaning your hit rate has to be much better for the cache to be worth while. The most light weight, but dumb caching strategy I know is to use an array with a hashcode. e.g. Note: the array is not thread safe, but since the Point is immutable, this doesn't matter.The cache works on a best effort basis, and is naturally limited in size with a very simple eviction strategy.

One way to achieve this is the Factory Pattern which, from what you say, the guy is describing. Another one would be to use a framework that does IOC for you, like Spring: (which is really not that far from the Factory Pattern) A third option is to make your own IOC Mechanism that deals with object instanciation in some way so you don't have to do it explicitly every time. The idea here is not to stop using the constructor to create instances, you always use that to get your instances, the idea here is WHEN and HOW you call that constructor: There are advantages to both ways. More often than not is better to deal with instanciation separatelly and not do it manually as it leads to cleaner, less coupled and more testable code."

You'd probably think ""that maths to work out what day of the week it is should be in a method of its own, so it can be expressed once and only once, with the method being called wherever the code needs to know what day of the week it is"". Constructing an object is no different to working out what day of the week it is, really. Do it in one place, make that a method, and call that method from wherever you need a new object. Now, in some cases, that method can itself be the constructor (a constructor is really just a funny kind of method, right?). In others, the method will call the constructor, which will not be used anywhere else. It depends on how much work there is to do to create the object, and how much you want to hide the class of the object being created (imagine a factory method - it could return a, and hide the fact that it's an or or or whatever). Wrapping the construction in a factory method gives you more encapsulation, but less transparency.

Even you reorder the code in the constructor so that adding the new instance to the map is the last thing you do, the JVM is allowed to reorder the instructions so that the object is added to the list first. Or, if the class is extended, the subclass initialization could take place after the object has been published. If more than one thread accesses the interacts with the class, you could have a concurrency bug that is platform dependent, intermittent, and very tough to diagnose. The article, by Brian Goetz has more information on this topic. Back to the original question: using, as mentioned by others, is a good approach, but rather than iterating over every entry in the map, I'd recommend creating a wrapper for your values that extends (it could be your itself, or a helper), and queuing each reference in a. That way, you can quickly poll the queue for any collected entries, and remove them from the map.

Here is a sample class with the toObjectArray() method that I would like to get rid of: The instance variables do not have to be returned in order.I have a custom annotation which allows me to reflect proper order for the object array.I'm simply wondering if it is possible to dynamically iterate the instance variables and values of an object in order to create an object array. Something like this... Any help would be greatly appreciated.Please let me know if I need to be more clear. Thank you!

I mean, if I make changes to the node, consequently to the object that it refers to, list will be also affected by these changes. However, what I don't understand that do node.next and list.next also refer to the same object. I mean if I wrote the linkedlist like Does that mean I am also changing list with the list.next? Or if I write (node.next.name = ""B""), do I also change the name of the list.next element?. I know the questions seems silly but I really don't know anything about references.

When you assign a value to you're storing the address of an object in that location.The same address can be stored other places, allowing the object to be accessed from different locations in the code. If you have a linked-list Node object, it presumably has fields for ""next"" and ""name"".The name field in this case is presumably a reference to an object (eg, a String) that is the ""value"" of the node (or at least part of the node's ""value).The ""next"" field is pretty much guaranteed to typed to hold a Node reference (though the value may be null for end-of-list). So your local variable may ""point"" to a Node object that contains a field that ""points"" to yet another Node object that contains a ""next"" field that points to yet another Node object, ad infinitum.(One important thing to understand is that, just because you have a Node object with a ""next"" field that points somewhere does not mean that Node object's ""next"" field points to that same somewhere.The name of the field is not the identity of the object.) When you do something like that can be decomposed into: The ""name"" field in the Node that you would address with node.next is changed. gives you the address of the closest Node, and then gives you the address of the node next to the closest Node. This sequence (from your original post): is something you might see in code that is beginning to traverse the list.The first line initializes from the ""list head"" pointer named.Then the second line ""advances"" node to the second Node in the list.So that after this statement is addressing the second Node of the list."

As with standard linked list and array operations, the various methods will have different algorithmic runtimes. ForFor allows for constant-time insertions or removals, but only sequential access of elements.In other words, you can walk the list forwards or backwards, but finding a position in the list takes time proportional to the size of the list. , on the other hand, allow fast random read access, so you can grab any element in constant time.But adding or removing from anywhere but the end requires shifting all the latter elements over, either to make an opening or fill the gap.Also, if you add more elements than the capacity of the underlying array, a new array (1.5 times the size) is allocated, and the old array is copied to the new one, so adding to an ArrayList is O(n) in the worst case but constant on average. So depending on the operations you intend to do, you should choose the implementations accordingly.Iterating over either kind of List is practically equally cheap.(Iterating over an is technically faster, but unless you're doing something really performance-sensitive, you shouldn't worry about this -- they're both constants.) The main benefits of using a arise when you re-use existing iterators to insert and remove elements. These operations can then be done in O(1) by changing the list locally only. In an array list, the remainder of the array needs to be (i.e. copied). On the other side, seeking in a means following the links in O(n), whereas in an the desired position can be computed mathematically and accessed in O(1). Also, if you have large lists, keep in mind that memory usage is also different.Each element of a LinkedList has more overhead since pointers to the next and previous elements are also stored.ArrayLists don't have this overhead.However, ArrayLists take up as much memory as is allocated for the capacity, regardless of whether elements have actually been added. The default initial capacity of an ArrayList is pretty small (10 from Java 1.4 - 1.7).But since the underlying implementation is an array, the array must be resized if you add a lot of elements.To avoid the high cost of resizing when you know you're going to add a lot of elements, construct the ArrayList with a higher initial capacity. It's worth noting that also implements the List interface and is almost identical to ArrayList.The difference is that Vector is synchronized, so it is thread-safe.Because of this, it is also slightly slower than ArrayList.So as far as I understand, most Java programmers avoid Vector in favor of ArrayList since they will probably synchronize explicitly anyway if they care about that."

Similarly, you can get better throughput in an app from the default throughput tenured garbage collector, but once you get java apps with 10GB heaps you can wind up locking up the app for 25 seconds during a Full GCs which causes timeouts and failures in SOA apps and blows your SLAs if it occurs too often.Even though the CMS collector takes more resources and does not achieve the same raw throughput, it is a much better choice because it has more predictable and smaller latency. ArrayList is only a better choice for performance if all you mean by performance is throughput and you can ignore latency.In my experience at my job I cannot ignore worst-case latency."

Hence removal only requires change in the pointer location in the two neighbor nodes (elements) of the node which is going to be removed. While In ArrayList all the elements need to be shifted to fill out the space created by removed element. 3) LinkedList add method gives O(1) performance while ArrayList gives O(n) in worst case. Reason is same as explained for remove. 4) ArrayList maintains indexes and element data while LinkedList maintains element data and two pointers for neighbor nodes hence the memory consumption is high in LinkedList comparatively. There are between these classes which are as follows: Both ArrayList and LinkedList are implementation of List interface.They both maintain the elements insertion order which means while displaying ArrayList and LinkedList elements the result set would be having the same order in which the elements got inserted into the List.Both these classes are non-synchronized and can be made synchronized explicitly by using Collections.synchronizedList method.The iterator and listIterator returned by these classes are fail-fast (if list is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator��Η��s own remove or add methods, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException). 1) As explained above the insert and remove operations give good performance (O(1)) in LinkedList compared to ArrayList(O(n)). Hence if there is a requirement of frequent addition and deletion in application then LinkedList is a best choice. 2) Search (get method) operations are fast in Arraylist (O(1)) but not in LinkedList (O(n)) so If there are less add and remove operations and more search operations requirement, ArrayList would be your best bet."

One of reason is: what if B had methods/fields that A doesn't and someone woild like to use them via reference? Would that be safe? No. This would make application crash. Only way to be able to cast object from reference to reference is when under is instance of class like in this example Here we know that object is in fact instance of B class so casting it to its type is safe. So back to your example you cant expectto cast correctly from object of type to more precise type, but you would be able to do this in situation like this because now we are trying to cast to its type. You could say that one way to resolve this problem is to check most common type of all list elements and create array of that type, but this wont work in situations where all elements of list will be derived from generic type. Take a look now most common type is, not so would return array of class like and such array cant be cast to because it could lead to trying to add elements that extend A but not B to this array.

The Javadoc for (no arguments) is. As you can see, this method returns an and which is an array of the runtime type of your list: Right below that method, though, is for. As you can see, this method returns a where is the type of the array you pass in. At first this seems like what you're looking for, but it's unclear exactly why you're passing in an array (are you adding to it, using it for just the type, etc). The documentation makes it clear that the purpose of the passed array is essentially to define the type of array to return (which is exactly your use case): Of course, an understanding of generics (as described in the other answers) is required to really understand the difference between these two methods. Nevertheless, if you first go to the Javadocs, you will usually find your answer and then see for yourself what else you need to learn (if you really do). Also note that reading the Javadocs here helps you to understand what the structure of the array you pass in should be. Though it may not really practically matter, you should not pass in an empty array like this: Because, from the doc, this implementation checks if the array is large enough to contain the collection; There's no need for the extra overhead in creating a new array when you could easily pass in the size. As is usually the case, the Javadocs provide you with a wealth of information and direction. Hey wait a minute, what's reflection?"

The overall complexity is going to be O(n log(n)), which is roughly the same as what you would get with a Set (n times long(n)), but with a much smaller constant. This is because the constant in sort/dedup results from the cost of comparing elements, whereas the cost from the set is most likely to result from a hash computation, plus one (possibly several) hash comparisons. If you are using a hash-based Set implementation, that is, because a Tree based is going to give you a O( n log���_(n) ), which is even worse. As I understand it, however, you do not need to duplicates, but merely test for their existence. So you should hand-code a merge or heap sort algorithm on your array, that simply exits returning true (i.e. ""there is a dup"") if your comparator returns 0, and otherwise completes the sort, and traverse the sorted array testing for repeats. In a merge or heap sort, indeed, when the sort is completed, you will have compared every duplicate pair unless both elements were already in their final positions (which is unlikely).

In fact, I think that having any sort of output (be it to disk or to the screen) will be at least an order of a magnitude slower than having to worry about the performance of string concatenations.As pointed out in the comments, the above compiler optimization is indeed creating a new instance of on each iteration. (Which I have noted previously.) The most optimized technique to use will be the response by, as it only instantiates a single object outside of the loop. Rewriting to the above code to: Will only instantiate the once outside of the loop, and only make the two calls to the method inside the loop, as evidenced in this bytecode (which shows the instantiation of and the loop): So, indeed the hand optimization should be better performing, as the inside of the loop is shorter and there is no need to instantiate a on each iteration."

When this size is exceeded, the collection is automatically increases to half of the default size that is 15.Vector is similar to ArrayList but the differences are, it is synchronized and its default initial size is 10 and when the size exceeds its size increases to double of the original size that means the new size will be 20. Vector is the only class other than ArrayList to implement RandomAccess. Some other differences are:"

If you are only interested in object equality, then the implementation of .equals() (the one provided by Object) uses identity only (i.e. this == other).If that's what you want, then just don't implement equals() on your class (let it inherit from Object).The code you wrote, while kind of correct if you are going for identity, would never appear in a real class b/c it provides no benefit over using the default Object.equals() implementation.

Here is an example of how the would increase in size: So the list starts with a capacity of, when the 11th item is added it is increase by to. On the 17th item the is increased again to and so on. Now consider the example where we're creating a list where the desired capacity is already known as. Creating the without the size constructor will call times which takes normally or on resize.

A List, on the other hand, is a collection of elements with order - ArrayList happens to use an array as the back end storage mechanism, but that is irrelevant.Each indexed element is a single element in the list. edit: based on your comment, I have added the following information: The key is stored in a hashmap.This is because a hash is not guaranteed to be unique for any two different elements.Thus, the key has to be stored in the case of hashing collisions.If you simply want to see if an element exists in a set of elements, use a Set (the standard implementation of this being HashSet).If the order matters, but you need a quick lookup, use a LinkedHashSet, as it keeps the order the elements were inserted.The lookup time is O(1) on both, but the insertion time is slightly longer on a LinkedHashSet.Use a Map only if you are actually mapping from one value to another - if you simply have a set of unique objects, use a Set, if you have ordered objects, use a List."

So one way holds onto memory, the other one throws out its memory and gets reallocated from scratch (with the default capacity).

Note, the present code is used to show how the class may be, not the actual implementation.

In an array, you can access to any element by using, while in a linked list you must navigate through all the list starting from until you get the element you need. Deletion time for ArrayList: Access time + O(n).Deletion time for LinkedList: Access time + O(1). The ArrayList must move all the elements from to starting by the item to delete index. The LinkedList should navigate until that item and then erase that node by decoupling it from the list. Insertion time for ArrayList: O(n).Insertion time for LinkedList: O(1). Why the ArrayList can take O(n)? Because when you insert a new element and the array is full, you need to create a new array with more size (you can calculate the new size with a formula like 2 * size or 3 * size / 2). The LinkedList just add a new node next to the last. This analysis is not just in Java but in another programming languages like C, C++ and C#.More info here:"

Modern computer technology seems, by my testing, to give an enormous edge to arrays.Elements of an array can be shifted and copied at insane speeds.As a result arrays and ArrayList will, in most practical situations, outperform LinkedList on inserts and deletes, often dramatically.In other words, ArrayList will beat LinkedList at its own game. The downside of ArrayList is it tends to hang onto memory space after deletions, where LinkedList gives up space as it gives up entries. The downside of arrays and ArrayList is they fragment free memory and overwork the garbage collector.As an ArrayList expands, it creates new, bigger arrays, copies the old array to the new one, and frees the old one.Memory fills with big contiguous chunks of free memory that are not big enough for the next allocation.Eventually there's no suitable space for that allocation.Even though 90% of memory is free, no individual piece is big enough to do the job.The GC will work frantically to move things around, but if it takes too long to rearrange the space, it will throw an OutOfMemoryException.If it doesn't give up, it can still slow your program way down. The worst of it is this problem can be hard to predict.Your program will run fine one time.Then, with a bit less memory available, with no warning, it slows or stops. LinkedList uses small, dainty bits of memory and GC's love it.It still runs fine when you're using 99% of your available memory. So in general, use ArrayList for smaller sets of data that are not likely to have most of their contents deleted, or when you have tight control over creation and growth.(For instance, creating one ArrayList that uses 90% of memory and using it without filling it for the duration of the program is fine.Continually creating and freeing ArrayList instances that use 10% of memory will kill you.)Otherwise, go with LinkedList (or a Map of some sort if you need random access).If you have very large collections (say over 100,000 elements), no concerns about the GC, and plan lots of inserts and deletes and no random access, run a few benchmarks to see what's fastest."

List: Map: So as other answers have discussed, the list interface (ArrayList) is an ordered collection of objects that you access using an index, much like an array (well in the case of ArrayList, as the name suggests, it is just an array in the background, but a lot of the details of dealing with the array are handled for you).You would use an ArrayList when you want to keep things in sorted order (the order they are added, or indeed the position within the list that you specify when you add the object). A Map on the other hand takes one object and uses that as a key (index) to another object (the value).So lets say you have objects which have unique IDs, and you know you are going to want to access these objects by ID at some point, the Map will make this very easy on you (and quicker/more efficient).The HashMap implementation uses the hash value of the key object to locate where it is stored, so there is no guarentee of the order of the values anymore.There are however other classes in the Java API that can provide this, e.g. LinkedHashMap, which as well as using a hash table to store the key/value pairs, also maintains a List (LinkedList) of the keys in the order they were added, so you can always access the items again in the order they were added (if needed)."

The only good way to access elements in an arraylist is by getting the elements by their index-number. So, this means you can use every type of key you want (with a HashMap). Another helpfull example is in a game: You have a set of images, and you want to flip them.So, you write a image-flip method, and then store the flipped results: You flipped player once, and then store it. You can access a BufferedImage with a BufferedImage as key-type for the HashMap. I hope you understand my second example. Hope this helps."

For example, you might have a list of files to process. Use a map for a (usually unordered) mapping from key to value. For example, you might have a map from a user ID to the details of that user, so you can efficiently find the details given just the ID. (You implement the interface by just storing a list of keys and a list of values, but generally there'll be a more efficient implementation - uses a hash table internally to get amortised O(1) key lookup, for example.)"
